title: Deploying Operations Manager in vCHS and vCloud
---

Installing Pivotal CF Ops Manager is the same for vCHS and vCloud.
In both cases you use vCloud Director to deploy PCF as a vApp in a virtual data
center (vDC).

Before you begin, decide what vDC, and what network within that vDC, are
where you want the PCF vApp to run.

1. Collect the information that describes where you want the PCF vApp to run:
  + The name of the vDC
  + Your credentials for the vDC
  + The name of the network
  + The netmask, default gateway, DNS server(s), and NTP server(s) for the network
  + The IP address for the PCF vApp on the network
  + If the vDC's network is private, the external IP address to be routed to the PCF IP address

1. Download Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCHS or Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCloud from [Pivotal Network]
(https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf).
This is an **ova* file.

1. Log into vCloud Director.

1. Navigate to the **My Organization's Catalogs** view and select a catalog or click the "plus" icon to create a new catalog.

    and then uploads it to your catalog.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_13.png") %><br />

    **Note**: The gateway and netmask shown in the dialog should match the ones you collected in Step 1.

1.  Enter the desired networking information, set an admin password for the PCF vApp, note the admin username shown, and click **Next**.

    **Note**: The IP Address you enter will be the location of the Pivotal CF Operations Manager interface.
