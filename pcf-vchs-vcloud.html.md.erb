title: Deploying Operations Manager in vCHS and vCloud
---

Pivotal CF Ops Manager is a web application that runs on a virtual machine in
vCHS and vCloud.
To use this web application, you begin by uploading the Ops Manager VM template
in vCloud Director.
The VM template is what vSphere calls an OVF Template, in the form of an
**.ova** file.

You use vCloud Director to deploy Ops Manager as a vApp in a virtual data
center (vDC).
The procedure is the same for vCHS and vCloud.

Before you begin, decide where you want the Ops Manager vApp to run.
In general, that means a vDC and a network within that vDC.

1. Collect the information needed to deploy the Ops Manager vApp:
  + The name of the vDC
  + Your credentials for the vDC
  + The name of the network
  + The netmask, default gateway, DNS server(s), and NTP server(s) for the network
  + The IP address for the Ops Manager vApp on the network
  + If the vDC's network is private, the external IP address to be routed to the Ops Manager vApp IP address

1. Download Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCHS or Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCloud from [Pivotal Network]
(https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf).

1. Log into vCloud Director in the vDC where you want to deploy.

1. Navigate to the **My Organization's Catalogs** view and select a catalog or click the "plus" icon to create a new catalog.

1. If you are creating a new catalog:
  + Enter a name for the new catalog and click **Next**.
  + Select a storage type and click **Next**.
  + Specify sharing (if needed) and click **Next**.
  + Review your settings and click **Finish**.

1. Navigate to the **vApp Templates** tab for your catalog and click the "upload" icon.

  **Note** The first time you upload software to vCloud Director, you are required to install
  the **Client Integration Plug-in** and restart all browsers.

1. Select **Local file** and browse to your **ova** file.

1. Enter a name for your Ops Manager vApp, enter a description (optional), and click **Upload**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_03b.png") %><br />

    vCloud Director transfers the vApp Template (the OVF package) to a staging environment,
    and then uploads it to your catalog.

1.  Navigate to the **Home** view and click the **Add vApp from Catalog** icon.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_07.png") %><br />

1.  Select your Ops Manager vApp and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_09.png") %><br />

1. 	Check the "I agree" checkbox to accept licenses and click **Next**.

1.  Enter the name of your Ops Manager vApp, select the virtual data center where the vApp should run, and click **Next**.

1.  Choose a storage policy, **note its name**, and click **Next**. Changing the name of the Virtual Machine and Computer Name is allowed but not usually necessary.

1.  Set the network mapping **Destination** to the network name from Step 1, set **IP allocation** to `Static â€” Manual`, and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_13.png") %><br />

    **Note**: The gateway and netmask shown in the dialog should match the ones you collected in Step 1.

1.  Enter the desired networking information, set (and note) an admin password for the Ops Manager vApp, **note the admin username shown**, and click **Next**.

1.  Review the hardware specifications of the virtual machine and click **Next**.

1.  In the **Ready to Complete** dialog, check the **Power on after deployment** checkbox and click **Finish**.

1.  Navigate to the **Home** view to verify that your Ops Manager vApp is being created.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_17.png") %><br />

1. Once the VM boots, verify that Ops Manager is available:
  + If the vDC's network is private, at the external IP address routed to the IP address you entered
  + Otherwise, at the IP address you entered

**Note**: The storage policy and vCD credentials you noted while deploying will be needed when you start using Ops Manager. The admin username and password you noted are only for troubleshooting purposes.
