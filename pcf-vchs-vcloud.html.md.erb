title: Deploying Operations Manager in vCHS and vCloud
---

_This topic assumes that you want to deploy Pivotal CF Operations Manager on VMware vCloud or on VMware vCloud Hybrid Service (vCHS)._

vCloud Director is a web UI that you use to manage your cloud environment.
Pivotal CF Ops Manager (PCF) is a web application that runs on a virtual machine.
This topic explains how to use vCloud Director to deploy PCF as a vApp in your virtual data center.

Refer to the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/p1-v1.1/opsmanager_ki.html) topic before getting started. _Is there a relevant Known Issues topic?_

1. Collect the following information:
  + The name of the virtual data center where you want PCF to run
  + Your credentials for the virtual data center
  + The name of the virtual data center's network (the one you want if there are more than one)
  + The netmask, default gateway, DNS server(s), and NTP server(s) for the network
  + The IP address on that network that you want for PCF
  + If the vDC's network is private, the external IP address that is routed to the PCF IP address

1. Download Pivotal CF Operations Manager from [Pivotal Network]
(https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf). _Check with Releng to make sure right thing is there._
