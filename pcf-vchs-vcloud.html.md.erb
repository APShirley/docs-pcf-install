title: Deploying Operations Manager to vCHS and vCloud
---

Pivotal CF Ops Manager is the interface you use to manage your Pivotal CF installation.

Refer to this topic for help deploying Ops Manager to vCHS or vCloud. For help deploying Ops Manager to VMware vSphere, refer to the [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html) topic.

The following procedure steps you through using the vCloud Director interface to deploy Ops Manager as a vApp in a virtual data
center (vDC).

1. Download Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCHS or Pivotal CF Operations Manager for vCloud from [Pivotal Network]
(https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf).

1. Log into vCHS or vCloud.

1. Access the vCloud Director in the virtual data center where you want to deploy Ops Manager.

    **Note**: The vCloud Director Web Console only supports 32-bit browsers, including Firefox.
It does not support Chrome.
Refer to Article 2034554 in the [VMware Knowledge Base](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/searchEntry.do) for more information about browser versions that the vCloud Director supports.

1. Navigate **Catalogs > My Organization's Catalogs** and select a catalog or click the **Add** icon to create a new catalog.

  + Enter a name for the new catalog and click **Next**.
  + Select a storage type and click **Next**.
  + Specify sharing (if needed) and click **Next**.
  + Review your settings and click **Finish**.

1. Navigate to the **vApp Templates** tab for your catalog and click the "upload" icon.

  **Note**: The first time you upload software to vCloud Director, you are required to install
  the **Client Integration Plug-in** and restart all browsers.

1. Select **Local file** and browse to your **ova** file.

1. Enter a name for your Ops Manager vApp, enter a description (optional), and click **Upload**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_03b.png") %><br />

    vCloud Director transfers the vApp Template (the OVF package) to a staging environment,
    and then uploads it to your catalog.

1.  Navigate to the **Home** view and click the **Add vApp from Catalog** icon.

1.  Select your Ops Manager vApp and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_09.png") %><br />

1. 	Check the "I agree" checkbox to accept licenses and click **Next**.

1.  Enter the name of your Ops Manager vApp, select the virtual data center where the vApp should run, and click **Next**.

1.  Set the network mapping **Destination** to the network name from Step 1, set **IP allocation** to `Static â€” Manual`, and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_13.png") %><br />

    **Note**: The gateway and netmask shown in the dialog should match the ones you collected in Step 1.

1.  Enter the desired networking information, set an admin password for the Ops Manager vApp and click **Next**.

1.  Review the hardware specifications of the virtual machine and click **Next**.

1.  In the **Ready to Complete** dialog, check the **Power on after deployment** checkbox and click **Finish**.

1.  Navigate to the **Home** view to verify that your Ops Manager vApp is being created.

    <%= image_tag("pcf_vcloud_17.png") %><br />

1. Once the VM boots, verify that Ops Manager is available:
  + If the vDC's network is private, at the external IP address routed to the IP address you entered
  + Otherwise, at the IP address you entered

**Note**: The storage policy and vDC credentials you noted while deploying will be needed when you start using Ops Manager. The admin username and password you noted are only for troubleshooting purposes.
