Customizing Platform Log Forwarding is a feature in newer versions of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 

In newer versions of PCF, you can forward logs to remote endpoints using the Syslog protocol defined in [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424).

For more information, see [Customizing Platform Log Forwarding](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/custom-syslog-rules.html).
