<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic describes how to install and configure Elastic Runtime for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed the [Configuring Ops Manager Director on GCP](./cloudform-om-config.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html">install the PCF IPsec add-on</a>, you must do so before installing any other tiles. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile. </p> 

## <a id='add-er'></a> Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager Installation
Dashboard.

1. If you have not downloaded Elastic Runtime, click the Pivotal Network link on the left to download the Elastic Runtime .pivotal file. Click **Import a Product** to add the tile to Ops Manager. For more information, refer to the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic.

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile in the Installation Dashboard.

## <a id='assign-az'></a> Step 2: Assign Availability Zones and Networks ##

1. Select **Assign AZ and Networks**. These are the Availability Zones that you [create](./gcp-om-config.html#az) when configuring Ops Manager Director.

1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**. Ops Manager runs any job with a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**. Ops Manager balances instances of jobs with more than one instance across the Availability Zones that you specify.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For production deployments, Pivotal recommends at least three Availability Zones for a highly available installation of Elastic Runtime.</p>

1. From the **Network** drop-down box, choose the network on which you want to run Elastic Runtime.

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you save this form, a verification error displays because the PCF security group blocks ICMP. You can ignore this error.</p>
    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er-network-error.png") %>

## <a id='cname'></a> Step 3: Add DNS Records for Your Custom Domain ##

In this step you redirect all wildcard queries for your domain to the IP address of your HAProxy load balancer.

1. Find the IP address of your load balancer. See the [Create Load Balancers in GCP](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create_loadbalancers) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP_ topic for the step where you assign the IP address to your HAProxy load balancer.

1. Log in to the DNS registrar that hosts your domain. Examples of DNS registrars include Network Solutions, GoDaddy, and Register.com.

1. Create an A record with your DNS registrar that points `*.EXAMPLE.com` to the IP address of your HAProxy load balancer. Replace EXAMPLE.com with a domain for which you have administrative rights. Alternately, if you are using different subdomains for your apps and system, set up A records for `*.APPSDOMAIN.EXAMPLE.com` and `*.SYSTEMDOMAIN.EXAMPLE.com`. Use the same system and apps domain names that you configure in the next configuration step, [Configure Domains](#er-domain-config).

1. Save changes within the web interface of your DNS registrar.

1. In a terminal window, run the following `dig` command to confirm that you created your A record successfully:

    <pre class='terminal'>dig xyz.EXAMPLE.COM</pre>

    You should see the A record that you just created:
    <pre class='terminal'>
;; ANSWER SECTION:
xyz.EXAMPLE.COM.      1767    IN  A 203.0.113.1</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You <strong>must</strong> complete this step before proceeding to Cloud Controller configuration. A difficult-to-resolve problem can occur if the wildcard domain is improperly cached before the A record is registered. </p>

## <a id='er-domain-config'></a> Step 4: Configure Domains ##

1. Select **Domains**.

    <%= image_tag("domains.png") %>

1. Enter the system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime serves your apps.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. This prevents system and apps routes from overlapping. You will require two wildcard DNS entries, one for the system and one for apps. For example,  <code>*.system.EXAMPLE.COM</code> and <code>*.apps.EXAMPLE.COM</code>. Point both wildcard domains at your HAProxy IP address.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You configured a wildcard DNS record
    for these domains in an earlier step.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='filestore'></a>Step 12: Configure File Storage ##

1. In the Elastic Runtime tile, select **File Storage**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a highly resilient and redundant filestore. This approach minimizes downtime of system operability and includes running <code>cf-push</code>.</p>

1. To use the PCF internal filestore, select **Internal WebDAV** and click **Save**.

1. To use an external S3-compatible filestore for your Elastic
Runtime file storage, select the **External S3-Compatible Filestore** option and complete the
following fields:

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/external_filestore_config.png") %>
    * For **URL Endpoint**:
        1. In a browser, open the [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) table](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).
        1. Prepend `https://` to the **Endpoint** for your region and copy it
          into the Ops Manager **URL Endpoint** field.
              <br />
              For example, in the **us-west-2** region, use
              `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/`.
    * For **S3 Signature Version** and **Region**, keep the default **V2 Signature** values unless your S3 filestore is in Germany or China. These regions require a **V4 Signature**.
    * Select **Server-side Encryption (available for AWS S3 only)** to encrypt the contents of your S3 filestore. See the [AWS S3 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) for more information.
    * Use the values in your AWS [**Outputs**](#open-outputs) tab to complete the remaining fields as follows:
    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th>Ops Manager Field</th>

      <tr>
        <td>AWS Secret Key</td>
        <td>PcfIamUserSecretAccessKey</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. To use the external Google filestore for your Elastic Runtime file storage, select the **External Google Cloud Storage** option and complete the following required fields:
    * For **Access Key**, add your `google_storage_access_key_id` from TK.
    * For **Secret Key**, add your `google_storage_secret_key_id` from TK.
    * For the **Buildpacks Bucket Name**, enter a name that describes the bucket for storing your app buildpacks.
    * For **Droplets Bucket Name**, enter a name for your app droplet storage. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name, but you can use the same name as the previous step.
    * For **Resources Bucket Name**, enter a name for resources. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name, but you can use the same name as the previous step.
    * For **Packages Bucket Name**, enter a name for packages. Pivotal recommends that you use a unique bucket name, but you can use the same name as the previous step.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='sys-logging'></a>Step 13: (Optional) Configure System Logging ##

If you are forwarding logging messages to an external Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) server, complete the following steps:

1. Select **System Logging**.
  <%= image_tag("cloudform/sys-logging.png") %>
1. If you want to include security events in your log stream, select the **Enable Cloud Controller security event logging** checkbox. This logs all API requests, including the endpoint, user, source IP address, and request result, in the Common Event Format (CEF).
1. Enter the IP address of your syslog server in **External Syslog Aggregator Hostname** and its port in **External Syslog Aggregator Port**. The default port for a syslog server is `514`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the Elastic Runtime network, accept TCP connections, and use the RELP protocol. Ensure your syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>

1. Select an **External Syslog Network Protocol** to use when forwarding logs.

1. For the **Syslog Drain Buffer Size**, enter the number of messages the Doppler server can hold from Metron agents before the server starts to drop them. See the [Loggregator Guide for Cloud Foundry Operators](../loggregator/log-ops-guide.html) topic for more details.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='customize-apps-man'></a>Step 14: (Optional) Customize Apps Manager##

<%= partial 'custombranding' %>

## <a id='smtp'></a>Step 15: (Optional) Configure Email Notifications ##

Elastic Runtime uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager
users.
You must complete the **Email Notifications** page if you want to enable
end-user self-registration.

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/smtp.png") %>

1. Enter your reply-to and SMTP email information.

1. For **SMTP Authentication Mechanism**, select `none`.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not configure the SMTP
settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using
the cf CLI tool. See <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a> for more information.</p>

## <a id='ccdb-key'></a>Step 16: (Optional) Add CCDB Restore Key##

<%= partial 'restore_ccdb_key' %>

## <a id='config-smoke-test'></a>Step 17: Configure Smoke Tests##

<%= partial 'smoketests' %>

## <a id='advanced-features'></a>Step 18: (Optional) Enable Advanced Features ##

Use caution when enabling advanced features if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

### <a id="disk-memory-overcommit"></a>Diego Cell Memory and Disk Overcommit

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the **Resource Config** tab, you might want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to each Diego Cell VM.

For example, you might want to use the overcommit if your apps use a small amount of disk and memory capacity compared with the **Resource Config** settings for **Diego Cell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to the risk of app failure and the deployment-specific nature of disk and memory use, Pivotal has no recommendation about how much, if any, memory or disk space to overcommit.</p>

To enable overcommit, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell memory value in the **Cell Memory Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell memory capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell disk capacity value in the **Cell Disk Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell disk capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Entries made to each of these two fields set the total amount of resources allocated, not the overage.</p>

### <a id="disable-privilege"></a> Disable Privileged App Containers

By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry deploys apps in privileged containers. Apps deployed to privileged containers can gain access to their host operating system. In general, Pivotal recommends disabling privileged containers by selecting this option.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not select <strong>Disable privileged app containers</strong> if you are running applications that use FUSE file system support. </p>

To disable privileged app containers, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced Features**.

    <%= image_tag("images/disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Select **Disable privileged app containers**. This setting only applies to newly pushed apps, so you must restart any pre-existing apps to apply this option.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Containers based on Docker images are always unprivileged, regardless of this setting.</p>

### <a id="enable-tcp"></a>Enable TCP Routing

TCP Routing is available for users who want an alternative to HTTP. For more information, including details about setting up your networking infrastructure for TCP Routing, see [Enabling TCP Routing](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html). 

1. TCP Routing is disabled by default. To enable this feature, select the **Enable TCP Routing** radio button. 

    <%= image_tag("images/tcp_routing.png") %>

1. You do not need to enter **TCP Router IPs** if you are using a GCP target pool. Instead, navigate to <strong>Resource Config</strong> and, in the **TCP Router** job, enter your GCP target pool in the **Target Pools** column. See [Step 22: Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer](#config-lb) for more information.

1. In **TCP Routing Ports**, enter the range of ports you reserved for TCP routes. These ports must be available on your load balancer. You can specify a list of ports with commas between each port number and specify ranges of ports with dashes between the first and last port number. This configuration only applies the first time you specify it here. If you later want to update the ports, see the [HTTP vs. TCP Routes](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-routes) section of the _Routes and Domains_ topic that describes using the cf CLI to update TCP Routing ports.

### <a id="disable-tcp"></a>Disable TCP Routing

1. If you want to disable TCP routing after enabling it, click **Select this option if you prefer to enable TCP Routing at a later time**.

1. Manually remove the TCP routing domain. 

## <a id='errands'></a>Step 19: Configure Errands Page ##

<%= partial 'errands' %>

## <a id='config-lb'></a>Step 20: Configure Load Balancers ##

1. If you do not know it, find the name of your target pool by clicking **Networking > Load Balancers** in the GCP Console, for example, `docs-lb`, `pcf-lb`, or `pcf-tcp-lb`. When you create a load balancer, GCP automatically creates a target pool for you using the load balancer name. 

    <%= image_tag("gcp/lb_names.png") %>

    For more information, see [Target pools](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/target-pools) in the GCP documentation.

1. In the **Elastic Runtime** tile, click **Resource Config**.

1. In the **Target Pools** field of the **HAProxy** row, enter the name of the load balancer target pool you set up in [Create the Load Balancer for HAProxy](gcp-prepare-env.html#gorouter_lb), prepended with `tcp:`. For example, `tcp:pcf-lb`. 

1. If you have enabled TCP routing in the [Advanced Features](#enable-tcp) pane,  in the **Target Pools** field of the **TCP Router** row, enter the name of your TCP load balancer target pool prepended with `tcp:`. 

1. Verify that the **Internet Connected** checkbox for every job is checked to allow the jobs to reach the Internet. 

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("gcp/resource_config.png") %>

## <a id='disable-resources'></a>Step 21: (Optional) Disable Unused Resources ##

<%= partial 'disable_resources' %>

## <a id='stemcell'></a>Step 22: Verify and Download Stemcell Version##

Verify whether Ops Manager is providing the stemcell version required by Elastic Runtime. If the correct version is already present, you do not need to download a new stemcell.

<a name="stemcellnote"></a>On the Pivotal Network download page for Elastic Runtime, check the stemcell version required by the Elastic Runtime version you are installing. For example:

1. In the Elastic Runtime tile, select **Stemcell**.

1. Verify that the version indicated in the filename matches the version of stemcell required by Elastic Runtime. 
  * If Elastic Runtime detects that a stemcell `.tgz` file is present in the Ops Manager Director VM at `/var/tempest/stemcells/`, the Stemcell screen displays filename information.
  <%= image_tag("stemcell_18.png") %>
  * If Elastic Runtime cannot detect a stemcell `.tgz` file, the following message displays:
  <%= image_tag("stemcell_not_found.png") %>
  If the version of the stemcell file that is loaded does not match the required version listed in Pivotal Network or cannot be found by Ops Manager, download a new stemcell file.

To download a new Stemcell: 

1. Log in to the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) and click on **Stemcells**.

1. Download the appropriate stemcell version targeted for your IaaS.

1. In Ops Manager, import the downloaded stemcell <code>.tgz</code> file.


## <a id='complete'></a>Step 23: Complete the Elastic Runtime Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/install-error.png") %>

    The install process generally requires a minimum of 90 minutes to complete.
    The image shows the Changes Applied window that displays when the
    installation process successfully completes.
