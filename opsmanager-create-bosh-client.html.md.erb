title: Creating UAA Clients for BOSH Director
owners: Ops Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process of creating a UAA client for the BOSH Director. You must create an automation client to run BOSH from a script or set up a continuous integration pipeline.

To perform this procedure, the UAAC client must be installed on the Ops Manager virtual machine (VM). 

1. Open a terminal and ssh into the Ops Manager VM. When prompted, enter your password.
	<pre class='terminal'>
    $ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
    Password: ***********
  </pre>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard** and select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. In Ops Manager Director, click the **Status** tab, and copy the **Ops Manager Director** IP address. 

1. Target the UAA on the Ops Manager Director VM using the IP address that you copied. 

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac target https://OPS-DIRECTOR-IP:8443 --ca-cert \
    /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate

    Target: http<span>s</span>://10.85.16.4:8443
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also curl or point your browser to the following endpoint to obtain the root certificate: <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/security/root_ca_certificate</code></p>

1. Log in to the Ops Director UAA and retrieve the owner token. To obtain the values for UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD and UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD:
       * Select the **Ops Manager Director** tile from the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. 
       * Click the **Credentials** tab, and locate the entries for **Uaa Login Client Credentials** and **Uaa Admin User Credentials**. 
       * For each entry, click **Link to Credential** to obtain the password. 

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac token owner get login -s UAA-LOGIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD
    User name:  admin
  	Password:  UAA-ADMIN-CLIENT-PASSWORD

  	Successfully fetched token via owner password grant.
  	Target: http<span>s</span>://10.85.16.4:8443
  	Context: admin, from client login
    </pre>
    
     
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To obtain the password for the UAA login and admin clients, you can also curl or point your browser to the following endpoints: <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_login_client_credentials</code>
    and <code>https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_admin_user_credentials</code>
    </div>

1. Create a new UAA Client with `bosh admin` privileges.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ uaac client add ci --authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    --authorities bosh.admin --secret CREATE-A-SECRET

    scope: uaa.none
    client_id: ci
    resource_ids: none
    authorized_grant_types: client_credentials
    autoapprove:
    action: none
    authorities: bosh.admin
    name: ci
    lastmodified: 1469727130702
    id: ci
    </pre>

1. Set the client and secret as environment variables on the VM.

	<pre class='terminal'>
   	$ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH_CLIENT=ci
  	$ ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-12:~$ export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=cipassword
	</pre>

1. Target BOSH using the client. Replace OPS\_MANAGER\_DIRECTOR\_IP with the IP address of your Ops Manager Director VM.

	<pre class='terminal'>
  	$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
  	target OPS_MANAGER_DIRECTOR_IP
	</pre>
  
You can now use the client you created to run BOSH from a script or a continuous integration pipeline.
