title: Creating a New User Account
---

Once you have successfully deployed Pivotal CF, complete one of the following
workflows to add users to your account.

## <a id='smtp'></a>Option 1: Adding new users if you have enabled SMTP ##

The Developer Console is a self-service tool to help manage organizations,
users, applications, and application spaces.
If you have set up SMTP, your users can access the Developer Console to sign up
for accounts and create their own orgs.

Instruct users to complete the following steps to log in and get started using
the Developer Console.

1. Browse to `console.<your-app-domain>`. Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Cloud
Controller** to locate your app domain.

1. Select **Create an Account**.

1. Enter your email address and click **Create an Account**.
You will receive an email from the Developer Console when your account is ready.

1. When you receive the new account email, follow the link in the email to
complete your registration.

1. You will be asked to choose your organization name.

You now have access to the Developer Console.
Refer to the Pivotal CF Developer Console documentation at
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) for more information about using
the Developer Console.

## <a id='admin'></a>Option 2: Adding new users as using the cf CLI tool ##

If you have not set up SMTP, the administrator account must create new users.
This workflow is not self-service for users.

See [Creating and Managing Users using the cf CLI Tool](../opsguide/cli-user-management.html) for more information.
