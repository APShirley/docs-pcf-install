Elastic Runtime defaults to a highly available configuration. If you do not want a highly available deployment, you must scale down your instances manually by navigating to the **Resource Config** section and using the drop-down menus under **Instances** for each job.

For more information about high availability, see the [Zero Downtime Deployment and Scaling in CF](../concepts/high-availability.html) and the [Scaling Instances in Elastic Runtime](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topics.

By default, Elastic Runtime also uses an internal filestore and internal databases.
If you configure Elastic Runtime to use external resources, you can disable the
corresponding system-provided resources in Ops Manager to reduce costs and
administrative overhead.

Complete the following procedures to disable specific VMs in Ops Manager:

1. Click **Resource Config**.

1. If you configure Elastic Runtime to use an external S3-compatible filestore,
edit the following fields:
    * **File Storage**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.

1. If you configure Elastic Runtime to use an external Relational Database
Service (RDS), edit the following fields:
    * **MySQL Proxy**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **MySQL Server**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **Cloud Controller Database**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **UAA Database**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.

1. If you are using an External Load Balancer instead of HAProxy, enter `0` in the **Instances** field for **HAProxy**.

1. Click **Save**.
