If you need to limit the number of connections to the backend, enter a value in the **Max Connections Per Backend** field. To choose a value for this property, operators should review the peak concurrent connections received by instances of their most popular apps. The number of concurrent connections for an app can be determined from the <code>httpStartStop</code> event metrics emitted for each app request.
