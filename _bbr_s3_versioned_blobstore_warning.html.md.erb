<p class="note warning"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>
In PAS 2.1.0, when configuring external S3 versioned blobstores, BBR cannot support any individual blob that is greater than 5GB in size. Consult your AWS Console to determine the size of your blobs. If your backups fail while using external S3 versioned blobstores, contact Pivotal Support.
