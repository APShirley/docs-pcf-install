To configure Gorouter behavior for handling client certificates, select one of the following options in the <b>Router behavior for Client Certificates</b> field. 
  <ul>
   <li> <b>Router does not request client certificates.</b> This option is incompatible with the XFCC configuration options <b>TLS terminated for the first time at HAProxy</b> and <b>TLS terminated for the first time at the Router</b> in PAS because these options require mutual authentication. As client certificates are not requested, client will not provide them, and thus validation of client certificates will not occur.</li>
   <li> <b>Router requests but does not require client certificates.</b> Gorouter requests client certificates in TLS handshakes, validates them when presented, but does not require them. This is the default configuration.</li>
   <li> <b>Router requires client certificates.</b> Gorouter validates that the client certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority that Gorouter trusts. If Gorouter cannot validate the client certificate, the TLS handshake fails.</li>
   </ul>
