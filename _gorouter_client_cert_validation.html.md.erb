To configure Gorouter behavior for handling client certificates, select one of the following options in the **Router behavior for Client Certificates** field. 
   * **Router does not request client certificates.** This option is incompatible with the XFCC configuration options **TLS terminated for the first time at HAProxy** and **TLS terminated for the first time at the Router** in PAS because these options require mutual authentication. As client certificates are not requested, client will not provide them, and thus validation of client certificates will not occur.
   * **Router requests but does not require client certificates.** Gorouter requests client certificates in TLS handshakes, validates them when presented, but does not require them. This is the default configuration.
   * **Router requires client certificates.** Gorouter validates that the client certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority that Gorouter trusts. If Gorouter cannot validate the client certificate, the TLS handshake fails.
