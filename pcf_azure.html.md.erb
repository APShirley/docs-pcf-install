This topic describes how to deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) on Microsoft Azure. This deployment is suitable for proof-of-concept or trial workloads, not for production.

PCF on Microsoft Azure is available as an offering in [Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/pivotal/pivotal-cloud-foundryazure-pcf/). The Azure Marketplace offering installs a pre-configured deployment of PCF and key PCF services. No upgrade path is available for this offering to a production deployment.

##<a id='components'></a>Components ##

PCF on Microsoft Azure includes the following components:

* [Elastic Runtime](../installing/pcf-docs.html)
* [RabbitMQ for PCF](../../../rabbitmq-cf/index.html)
* [MySQL for PCF](../../../p-mysql/index.html)
* [Redis for PCF](../../../redis/)
* [Spring Cloud Services for PCF](../../../spring-cloud-services/)

##<a id='resources'></a>Resources ##

PCF on Microsoft Azure allocates the following Azure resources:

* 53 VMs: The deployment uses a total of 53 VMs during the installation. 15 VMs are created to run jobs and errands and are subsequently destroyed. 38 VMs continue to run after installation. 
* 1 storage account
* 3 public IPs
* 1 jumpbox VM that runs the deployment using [BOSH](http://bosh.io/)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The cost per day for Azure resources varies, but it is likely in the $75-100 (US) range.</p>

##<a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites##

You must have the following in order to use PCF on Microsoft Azure:

* A pay-as-you-go subscription on your Azure account.

* A Pivotal Network account: If you do not already have an account, [create one](https://network.pivotal.io/). Retrieve the API token for your profile by performing the following steps:
    1. Sign into the Pivotal Network.
    1. Navigate to your name in the top right and click **Edit Profile**. 
    1. Record the API token located at the bottom of the page.

* An Azure command line tool on your machine. 
    * For Linux/Unix/Mac OS X, follow these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/) to install the Azure CLI. Then use this [shell script](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/bosh-azure-template/blob/master/create_azure_principal.sh) to create an Azure Service Principal. Record the `TENANT-ID`, `CLIENT-ID`, `CLIENT-SECRET` produced by the script.
    * For Windows, follow these [instructions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/) to install the Azure PowerShell. Then use this [PowerShell script](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/bosh-azure-template/blob/master/create_azure_principal_powershell.txt) to create an Azure Service Principal. Record the `TENANT-ID`, `CLIENT-ID`, `CLIENT-SECRET` produced by the script.

* Sufficient quota limits on your Azure account. Installing PCF requires more than the default 20 cores. Pivotal recommends 100 cores. For more information, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/). To raise your quota, follow the instructions in <a href="#raising-quota">Raise Your Quota</a> below.

###<a id="raising-quota"></a>Raise Your Quota###

* To request a core quota increase, follow these [instructions](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/girishp/2015/09/20/increasing-core-quota-limits-in-azure/).

* When filling in the Details section of the Support Request Description, provide the following information to expedite your request, replacing REGION with your region of choice: 

<blockquote>"We are preparing to roll out Pivotal Cloud Foundry from the Azure Marketplace. We would like to raise our ARM (Azure Resource Manager) core limits. We need 100 cores, mostly D-series. We are in REGION (<code>REGION</code>) region. We will need 1 TB of storage."</blockquote>

1. Search for “Pivotal Cloud Foundry” and select **Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Microsoft Azure** or navigate directly to the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Azure Marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/pivotal/pivotal-cloud-foundryazure-pcf/) page.
 <%= image_tag("azure/marketplace.png") %>
1. Click **Deploy >**.
1. Enter the following **User Inputs**:
    * **Storage Account Name Prefix**: Installing PCF on Microsoft Azure creates a new storage account. Use a unique prefix that contains letters and numbers and is no more than 10 characters long. For more information, see [About Azure storage accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-create-storage-account/).
    * **SSH public key**: You must generate 2048-bit RSA public and private key files.
    	* Linux/Unix/Mac OS X: From the command line, run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048`. Locate your public key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and paste the contents into the parameter **sshKeyData**.
    	* Windows: Download, install, and use [PuTTYgen](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Locate your public key file and and paste the contents into the parameter **sshKeyData**.
	* **Tenant ID**: Enter the `TENANT-ID` output from the Azure Service Principal creation script you ran in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * **Client ID**: Enter the `CLIENT-ID` output from the Azure Service Principal creation script you ran in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * **Client Secret**: Enter the `CLIENT-SECRET` output from the Azure Service Principal creation script you ran in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * **Pivotal Network Token**: Enter the API token of your Pivotal Network Account that you recorded in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.
    * **Resource Group**: Use a new resource group with a unique name for each new deployment. For more information about Azure resource groups, see [Manage Azure resources through portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal/).

##<a id='verify'></a>Verify the PCF on Microsoft Azure Installation ##

1. From your Azure Portal, navigate to **Resource Groups** and ensure the new **Resource Group** has been created.
	<%= image_tag("azure/resource_group.png") %>

1. SSH into the jumpbox VM by performing the following steps:
	1. Navigate to **Resource groups** > **cf** > **Deployment history** and select your deployment.
	1. Under the **Outputs** section, record the **JUMPBOX-FQDN**. This is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the jumpbox VM.
	1. Use a SSH client to open an SSH connection to the jumpbox VM, with the username `pivotal`. <strong>How to authenticate?</strong> For example, run the command `ssh pivotal@myjumpboxujnk2hiwzqq3y.westus.cloudapp.azure.com`.
 <%= image_tag("azure/jumpbox.png") %>

1. From the jumpbox VM, locate <code>pcf_install.log</code> at <code>/home/pivotal</code> to view the entire PCF deployment log.

1. At the end of deployment the following information gets printed on tmux session. This is used to log in to the Apps Manager console. For example:
 <pre class="terminal">
   print "============================================================"
   print "Apps Manager URL : {0}".format(apps\_manager\_address)
   print "Admin password   : {0}".format(admin\_password)
   print "Documentation    : <span>http:</span>//docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/pcf-docs.html"
   print "============================================================"
 </pre>

1. If the tmux session is lost, you can retrieve the admin password for Apps Manager from the Elastic Runtime manifest by performing the following command:
 <pre class="terminal">
$ cat manifests/elastic-runtime.yml | grep admin
  admin\_user: admin
  admin\_password: "0a0d2a13b6521ee2bf8b"
 </pre>

1. From your Azure Portal, navigate to **Resources** and find the **Public IP address** resource named <code>YOUR-JUMPBOX-NAME–cf</code> and select it. 
	<%= image_tag("azure/app_manager_one.png") %>
1. Record the **IP address**. This is the IP address of Apps Manager.
	<%= image_tag("azure/app_manager_two.png") %>
1. Navigate to the URL `https://apps.system.APPS-MANAGER-IP-ADDRESS.cf.pcfazure.com`, and log in to Apps Manager with the username `admin` and the password obtained above. 

1. From Apps Manager, verify that your services are running.
