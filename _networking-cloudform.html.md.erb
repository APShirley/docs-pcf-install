1. Select **Networking**.
<%= image_tag 'images/networking-config.png' %>
1. Leave the **Router IPs**, **SSH Proxy IPs**, and **HAProxy IPs** fields blank. You do not need to complete these fields when deploying PCF to AWS. Instead, add the name of your ELB in the Resource Config section, in the **ELB Name** column for the **Router** and the **Diego Brain**. See the [Configure Router to Elastic Load Balancer](#config-elb) section for instructions. 

Enter static IPs for the Diego Brain(s), which will accept requests to SSH into application containers on port 2222, and register a load balancer with these IPs. If deploying PCF to AWS with an ELB, do not enter IP addresses here. 

1. Under **Configure the point-of-entry to this environment**, choose one of the following:
  * **External Load Balancer with Encryption**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. Complete the fields for the **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** and **Router SSL Ciphers**.
  * **External Load Balancer without Encryption**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that cannot forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. 
  * **HAProxy**: Select this option to use HAProxy as your first point of entry. Complete the fields for **SSL Certificate and Private Key**, and **HAProxy SSL Ciphers**. Select **Disable HTTP traffic to HAProxy** if you want the HAProxy to only allow HTTPS traffic.  You can also generate a self-signed certificate using your wildcard system domain.
  <p class="note">For details about providing SSL termination certificates and keys, see the [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html#config) topic.</p> 
1. If you are not using SSL encryption or if you are using self-signed certificates, select **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment**.

1. Select the **Disable insecure cookies on the Router** checkbox to turn on the secure flag for cookies generated by the router.

1. In the **Choose whether or not to enable route services** section, choose either **Enable route services** or **Disable route services**. Route services are a class of [marketplace services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace) that perform filtering or content transformation on application requests and responses. See the [Route Services](../services/route-services.html) topic for details.
 
1. The **Loggregator Port** defaults to 443 if left blank. Enter a new value to override the default.
1. Optionally, use the **Applications Subnet** field if you need to avoid address collision with a third-party service on the same subnet as your apps. Enter a CIDR subnet mask specifying the range of available IP addresses assigned to your app containers. The IP range must be different from the network used by the system VMs.

1. Optionally, you can change the value in the **Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** field. Pivotal recommends setting the MTU value for your application network to `1454`. Some configurations, such as networks that use GRE tunnels, may require a smaller MTU value.   

1. Optionally, increase the number of seconds in the **Router Timeout to Backends** field to accommodate larger uploads over connections with high latency.
