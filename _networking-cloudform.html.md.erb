1. Select **Networking**.

<%= image_tag("cloudform/networking.png") %>

1. For **Router IPs**, enter one or more static IP addresses for your routers. These must be in the subnet that you configured in the Ops Manager **Create Networks** section. If you are using your own load balancer, configure it to point to these IPs. If you are using the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), add the name of your ELB in the router column of the **Resource Config** section.

1. For **HAProxy IPs**, enter one or more IP addresses for HAProxy. You must point your DNS to this IP unless you are using your own load balancer, and HAProxy's IP must be in your subnet.

1. Under **Configure the point-of-entry to this environment**, choose one of the following:
	* Select the first option if you are using an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router. You may also select this option for a development environment where load balancing is not required.

		  1. Enter your PEM encoded certificate and your PEM encoded private key in the fields under **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key**.
		  1. If you do not want SSL encryption, click **Generate RSA Certificate** for the Pivotal certificate authority to generate a certificate. You must also select **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment**. 

	* Select the second option if you are using an external load balancer that cannot forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router. You may also select this option for a development environment where load balancing is not required.

	* Select the third option if you are using HAProxy as your fist point of entry.

1. Leave the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields blank.

1. do the point of entry thing - there are a bunch of options for adding or not adding certs and keys -- here's a rough outline

top radio box - have ext LB w/ encrypted traffic forwarding to ER router
	Router SSL cert and key - 
		box for cert PEM text
		box for private key PEM
	Router SSL Ciphers
Enable TLS is checked

middle radio box - have ext LB w/OUT encrypted traffic forwarding, or non-production w/out LB
	no additional boxes
Enable TLS is not checked

bottom radio box - HAProxy, will travel
	SSL Cert and private Key
		box for cert PEM text
		box for private key PEM
	Checkbox - Disable HTTP traffic to HAProxy
	HAProxy SSL Ciphers
		box for ciphers-with-dashes-EDGHE-EFJEA...

1. Choose the appropriate radio box for your deployment under **Configure the point-of-entry to this environment**

1. Set **Loggregator Port** to **4443**.

1. Click **Save**.
