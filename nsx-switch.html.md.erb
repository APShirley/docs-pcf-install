1. From your PCF Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**, click the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 

1. Select **Create Networks**. 

1. Click the network name to configure the network settings. This will be **default** if you have have not changed the name.

1. Find the folder name and port group name for the switch, as you configured them in vCenter. For the example vSphere environment pictured below, the might want to use the switch configured on the `beer-apple` port group, which is in the `drinks-dc` folder.

1. In the **vSphere Network Name** field, instead of entering your network name, enter the folder name and port group name for the switch, as you configured them in vCenter. For the example vSphere environment pictured above, you would enter `drinks-dc/beer-apple` to use the switch configured on the `beer-apple` port group.
