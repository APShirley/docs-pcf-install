title: Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry
---

Refer to this topic for help backing up the contents of critical databases and
backing up and restoring your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation settings. Pivotal recommends that you back up your installation frequently.

## <a id='settings'></a>Backing Up and Restoring Installation Settings ##

Pivotal recommends that you back up your installation settings by exporting
frequently.
Always export an installation before importing a new one.
Import an installation to restore your settings or to share your settings with
another user.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Exporting your installation only backs up your installation settings. It does not back up your VMs or any external MySQL databases that you have configured on the Ops Manager <a href="./vsphere-config.html"><strong>Director Config</strong> page</a>.</p>

### <a id='export'></a>Exporting an Installation ###

From the Product Installation Dashboard in the Ops Manager interface, click the gear icon and select **Export installation settings**.
This option is only available after you have deployed at least one time.

<%= image_tag("action.png") %>

**Export installation settings** exports the current PCF installation
settings and assets.
When you export an installation, the exported file contains the base VM images,
necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
As a result, an export can be 5 GB or more.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For versions of Ops Manager 1.3 or older, the process of archiving files for export may exceed the timeout limit of 600 seconds, causing a 500 error. If this happens, you can fix the problem by manually configuring the timeout value to a longer limit, or by assigning more resources to the Ops Manager VM to improve performance. Refer to the <a href='https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/206113627-Exporting-installation-via-Ops-Manager-failed-with-error-500-An-error-occurred-Contact-Pivotal-Technical-Support-report-the-problem-'>Knowledge Base</a> for a more in depth discussion of this issue.</p>

### <a id='import'></a>Importing an Installation ###

1. From the Product Installation Dashboard, click the gear icon and select **Import installation settings**.

1. Browse to and select a PCF installation file.

1. If the admin password has changed since the file was exported, select **Need to enter a decryption password?** before you click **Import** to prevent an error. Enter the original password that was used when the            installation was exported. If the admin password has not changed, you may skip this step.

    <%= image_tag("import-installation-file.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

**Import installation settings** imports the settings and assets of an existing
PCF installation.
Importing an installation overwrites any existing installation.

## <a id='encrypt-key'></a>Back Up the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials ##

From the Product Installation Dashboard, select **Pivotal Elastic Runtime > Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.
Record the Cloud Controller **DB encryption credentials**.
You must provide these credentials if you contact Pivotal Support for help
restoring your installation.

<%= image_tag("ccdb-encrypt-creds.png") %>

## <a id='manifest'></a>Download the BOSH Deployment Manifest ##

1. Install Ruby and the [BOSH CLI Ruby gem](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/bosh-cli.html) on a machine outside of your PCF system deployment.
1. From the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager, select **Ops Manager Director > Status** and record the IP address listed for the Ops Manager Director.
You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

    <%= image_tag("director-ip.png") %>

1. Click **Credentials** and record the Director credentials.

    <%= image_tag("director-creds.png") %>

1. From the command line, target the BOSH Director using the IP address and credentials that you recorded:


    <pre class='terminal'>
        $ bosh target 10.0.0.3
        Target set to `microbosh-1234abcd1234abcd1234'
        Your username: director
        Enter password: ********************
        Logged in as `director'
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If <code>bosh target</code> does not prompt you for your username and password, run <code>bosh login</code>.</p>

1. Run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of the current BOSH deployment:
<pre class='terminal'>
	$ bosh deployments
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
	| Name            | Release(s)               | Stemcell(s)                                     |
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
	| cf-5678dcba5678 | cf-mysql/10              | bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/2690.3 |
	|                 | cf/183.2                 |                                                 |
	+-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

1. Run `bosh download manifest DEPLOYMENT-NAME LOCAL-SAVE-NAME` to download and
save the current BOSH deployment manifest.
You need this manifest to locate information about your databases.
Replace `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` with the name of the current BOSH deployment.
For this procedure, use `cf.yml` as the `LOCAL-SAVE-NAME`.
<pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh download manifest cf-5678dcba5678 cf.yml
    Deployment manifest saved to `cf.yml'
</pre>

## <a id='backup-databases'></a>Backing Up Critical Databases ##

This section describes the procedure for backing up databases associated with your PCF installation.

Your Elastic Runtime deployment contains several critical data stores that must be present for a complete restore.
You must back up each of the following:

* Cloud Controller Database
* UAA Database
* Apps Manager Database
* NFS Server
* Pivotal MySQL Server

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are running the default internal databases, follow the instructions below. If you are running your databases or filestores externally, disregard these instructions and ensure that you back up your external databases and filestores. </p>
