Ensure you have enough VMs allocated to support the newly-migrated apps. You can scale up your VMs from the Elastic Runtime tile, in the **Settings** tab, under **Resource Config**. Pivotal recommends the following configurations:

- **Diego Brain**: One instance per Availability Zone (AZ), or two if only a single AZ.
- **Diego Cell**: The **Diego Cell** VM has similar responsibility to the DEA VM to run applications. For example, if you have allocated three DEA instances with 32 GB of persistent disk and 32 GB of RAM for each, allocate three Diego Cell instances with 32 GB of persistent disk and 32 GB of RAM for each to have similar capacity on Diego as with DEAs.
- **Consul**, **etcd**, and **Diego BBS**: For each component, choose the odd number equal to or one greater than the number of AZs you have. For example, if you have four AZs, allocate five instances each for Consul, etcd, and Diego BBS. Pivotal recommends an odd number of instances because the instances must maintain quorum.

After scaling your virtual machines (VMs), click **Save** on the **Resource Config** page. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.
