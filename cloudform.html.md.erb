title: Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; on AWS
---

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the PCF CloudFormation template.

The CloudFormation template for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; describes the set of necessary AWS resources and properties. When you create an AWS stack using the PCF template, CloudFormation provisions all the infrastructure that you need to deploy PCF on AWS.

Pivotal strongly recommends using CloudFormation to install PCF on AWS. Contact [Pivotal Support](http://pivotal.support.io) if you cannot use CloudFormation for your installation.

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you are performing an upgrade from PCF 1.5 to 1.6, please review <a href="upgrading-pcf.html#pcf16upgrade">Upgrading Ops Manager</a> for critical upgrade information.</p>

## Prerequisites ##

You must have the following in order to follow the procedure described here:

* An AWS account that can accomodate the [minimum resource requirements](requirements.html#aws) for a PCF installation.
* The appropriate region selected within your AWS account. See the [Amazon documentation on regions and availability zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones) for help selecting the correct region for your deployment.
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine, and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits (or no instance limits) on your AWS account. Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances.
* A key pair to use with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; deployment. [Create a key pair in AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation. You will need this registered domain when configuring your SSL certificate and Cloud Controller.
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed cert, but Pivotal only recommends using a self-signed cert for testing and development. You should obtain a cert from your Certificate Authority for use in production.
