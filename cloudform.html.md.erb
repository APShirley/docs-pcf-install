title: Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry using AWS CloudFormation
---

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) using Amazon Web
Services (AWS) CloudFormation.

The CloudFormation template for Pivotal Cloud Foundry describes a set of AWS
resources and properties.
When you use this template to create an AWS stack, CloudFormation provisions the
infrastructure that you need to deploy PCF to AWS.

To install PCF on AWS without using a CloudFormation template, see the [Manually Configuring AWS for PCF](./pcf-aws-component-config.html) topic.

Complete the following procedures to install PCF using CloudFormation:

1. [Deploying the CloudFormation Template for PCF on AWS](./cloudform-template.html)

1. [Deploying Ops Manager Director on AWS CloudFormation](./cloudform-om-deploy.html)

1. [Configuring Ops Manager Director on AWS CloudFormation](./cloudform-om-config.html)

## Prerequisites ##

This guide assumes that you first complete the following steps:

* Remove or increase the instance limits in your AWS account. Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances. For more information on AWS instance limits, see the [limits section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Limits:) of the EC2 site on the AWS console.
* [Create a key pair in AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html) to use with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment.
