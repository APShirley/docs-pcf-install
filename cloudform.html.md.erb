title: Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS
---

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on Amazon Web
Services (AWS) using the PCF CloudFormation template.

The CloudFormation template for Pivotal Cloud Foundry describes the set of necessary AWS
resources and properties.
When you create an AWS stack using the PCF template, CloudFormation provisions all the
infrastructure that you need to deploy PCF on AWS.

Pivotal strongly recommends using CloudFormation to install PCF on AWS, but see the [Manually Configuring AWS for PCF](./pcf-aws-component-config.html) topic if you cannot use CloudFormation for your installation.

## Prerequisites ##

You must have the following in order to follow the procedure described here:

* An AWS account to use for the installation.
* The AWS CLI installed on your machine, and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits (or no instance limits) on your AWS account. Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances.
* A key pair to use with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. [Create a key pair in AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation.
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed cert, but Pivotal only recommends using a self-signed cert for testing and development. You should obtain a cert from your Certificate Authority for use in production.

Complete the following procedures to install PCF using CloudFormation:
