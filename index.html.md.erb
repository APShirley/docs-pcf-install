This topic provides an overview of how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='sequence'></a>PCF Installation Sequence

PCF is a suite of products that runs on multiple IaaSes. Planning and installing PCF means building layers from the bottom up, starting with the details of your IaaS and ending with "Day 2" configurations that you perform on a installed and running PCF deployment.

Here's the typical PCF planning and installation process:

1. **Plan**
  - Review the Requirements for your IaaS ([AWS](./aws.html), [Azure](./azure.html), [GCP](./gcp.html), [OpenStack](./openstack.html), [vSphere](./vsphere.html)).
  - Refer to the Reference Architecture for your IaaS.
  - Assess your platform needs, including capacity, availability, container support, host OS, resource isolation, and geographical distribution. Discuss with your Pivotal contact.

1. **Deploy BOSH and Ops Manager**
  - [BOSH](http://bosh.io) is an open-source tool that lets you run software systems in the cloud.
      - BOSH and its IaaS-specific Cloud Provider Interfaces (CPIs) are what enable PCF to run on multiple IaaSes.
      - See [Deploying with BOSH](#bosh) for a mini description of the BOSH deployment process.
   - [Ops Manager](./ops-man.html) is a GUI application deployed by BOSH that streamlines deploying subsequent software to the cloud via BOSH.
      - Ops Manager represents PCF products as _tiles_ with multiple configuration panes that let you input or select configuration values needed for the product.
      - Ops Manager generates BOSH manifests containing the user-supplied configuration values, and sends them to the Director.
      - After you install Ops Manager and BOSH, you use Ops Manager to deploy almost all PCF products.
  - Deploying Ops Manager deploys both BOSH and Ops Manager with a single procedure.
      - On AWS, you can deploy Ops Manager semi-automatically with a CloudFormation template, or manually.
      - On Azure, you can deploy Ops Manager semi-automatically with an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, or manually. You can only deploy Ops Manager to Azure Government Cloud or Azure Germany manually.

1. (Optional) Bosh Add-ons  can do later but works better 

1. Install PAS
Installing PAS fills in the last configuration details that PCF needs to abstract away the IaaS. Any tile that you install after PAS copies field values from your PAS configuration.

1. Day 2 Configurations

1. Populate marketplace with services

##<a id='bosh'></a>Deploying with BOSH

Here's how BOSH runs software in the cloud:

1. To use BOSH, you create a a _manifest_ `.yml` file that specifies your software system's component processes, the VMs they run on, how they communicate, and anything else they need.

2. The BOSH command-line interface (CLI) or API sends the manifest to the _Director_, BOSH's executive process.

3. The Director provisions what it needs from the IaaS, _deploys_ your software to run in the cloud, and heals automatically when VMs go down.

4. BOSH CLI and API commands let you control BOSH-managed processes and allocate or release IaaS resources.
