Compare evidence that you have gathered to the problem descriptions below.
If your problem is covered, try the recommended remediation procedures.

### <a id='bosh_install'></a>BOSH automated installation fails ###

Before starting a Elastic Runtime deployment, a vSphere cluster must be set up
and configured.

If vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) is enabled for the cluster, the
Automation level must be set to **Partially automated** or **Fully automated**.

If the Automation level is set to **Manual**, BOSH automated installation will
fail with a 'power\_on\_vm' error when BOSH attempts to create virtual VMs.

### <a id='net-settings'></a>Cannot connect to the OVF via a browser ###

If you deployed the OVF file but cannot connect to it via a browser, check that
the network settings you entered in the wizard are correct.

1. Access the Pivotal CF installation VM using the vSphere Console.
If your network settings are misconfigured, you will not be able to SSH into
the installation VM.

1. Log in using the credentials you provided when you imported the Pivotal CF
.ova in vCenter.

1. Confirm that the network settings are correct by checking that the ADDRESS,
NETMASK, GATEWAY, and DNS-NAMESERVERS entries are correct in
`/etc/network/interfaces`.

1. If any of the settings are wrong, run `sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces` and
correct the wrong entries.

1. In vSphere, navigate to the **Summary** tab for the VM and confirm that the
network name is correct.

1. If the network name is wrong, right click on the VM, select **Edit Settings > Network adapter 1**, and select the correct network.

1. Reboot the installation VM.
