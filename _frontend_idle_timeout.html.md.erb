(Optional) **Frontend Idle Timeout for Gorouter and HAproxy**: Use this field to help prevent connections to your load balancer from being closed prematurely. The value you enter sets the duration in seconds to maintain an open connection with a client that supports keep-alive. The value you enter depends on your IaaS:
	* In general, the timeout must be greater than that of the load balancer. For example:
		* GCP has a default timeout of 600 seconds, so Pivotal recommends a value greater than `600`.  
		* AWS ELB has a default timeout of 60 seconds, so Pivotal recommends a value greater than `60`.
	* In some cases, the timeout may need to be shorter than that of the load balancer. For example:
		* By default, Azure load balancer times out at 240 seconds without sending a TCP RST to clients, so Pivotal Recommends a value lower than `240` to force it to send the TCP RST.
