In the **TLS Cipher Suites for HAProxy** field, review the TLS cipher suites for TLS handshakes between HAProxy and its clients such as load balancers and Gorouter. The default value is `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.
If you want to modify the default configuration,
use an ordered, colon-delimited list of TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format.
<br> Operators should verify that the ciphers are supported by any clients or downstream components that will initiate TLS handshakes with HAProxy.
    <%= image_tag 'images/networking_tls_haproxy.png' %>
    Verify that every client participating in the TLS handshake with HAProxy has at least one cipher suite in common with HAProxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Specify cipher suites that are supported by the versions configured in the <strong>Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router</strong> field.</p>
