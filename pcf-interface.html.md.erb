  - **Add a new product**: Navigates to the Add Product view. You can either add a new product or import an existing configured product.

- **B**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to change your password or log out.

- **C**---**Actions menu**: Includes the following options:

  - **Import installation**: Navigates to the Import installation view. Select this option to import an existing Pivotal CF installation with all of its assets. When you import an installation, the prior installation will disappear and be replaced by the newly imported one.

  - **Export activity data**: Downloads a directory containing the the config file for the installation, the deployment history, and version information.

- **D**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued installations and updates that will install during the next deploy.

**Note**: Installs and updates automatically execute in the correct order.
That is, when an update depends on prerequisites, the prerequisites automatically install first.
