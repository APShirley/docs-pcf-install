- **A**---**Available Products**: Displays a list of products you have imported that are ready for installation. If an upgrade is available, an active **Upgrade** button appears when you hover over the name of the product. Click the **Import a Product** link to add a new product to Ops Manager. Click **Delete unused products** to delete any unused products.

- **B**---**Installation Dashboard**: Displays a product tile for each installed product.

- **C**---**Actions menu**: Includes the following options:

  - **Download activity data**: Downloads a directory containing the config file for the installation, the deployment history, and version information.

	- **View diagnostic report**: Displays various types of information about the configuration of your deployment.

 - **Export settings**: Exports the current installation with all of its assets. When you export an installation, the exported file contains references to the installation IP addresses. It also contains the base VM images and necessary packages. As a result, an export can be very large (as much as 5 GB or more).

 - **Delete this installation**: Deletes the current installation with all of its assets.

- **D**---**User account menu**: Use this menu to change your password or log out.

- **E**---**Pending Changes view**: Displays queued installations and updates that will install during the next deploy. Click **Apply Changes** to apply any pending changes to your deployment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When an update depends on prerequisites, the prerequisites automatically install first.</p>
