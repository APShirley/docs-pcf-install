title: Upgrading Products in a Pivotal CF Deployment
---

*Important:* Read the [Known Issues](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/pcf-release-notes/) section of the Release Notes before getting started.

This topic describes how to upgrade individual products like Elastic Runtime,
MySQL, or RabbitMQ in your Pivotal CF deployment.
[Upgrading Ops Manager](./upgrading-pcf.html) is a separate task.

These procedures are based on the assumption that your Pivotal CF deployment
includes Ops Manager and one or more products that show upgrades available.

/

1. Download the latest Pivotal CF releases for the products you want to upgrade
from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.gopivotal.com) site.

1. In the **Available Products** section of Pivotal Ops Manager:
    - Select one product and click **Import**
    - When importing is complete, click **Upgrade**
    - When upgrading is complete, click **Apply changes** in the right-hand panel

1. Repeat Step 2 for each additional product you want to upgrade.
