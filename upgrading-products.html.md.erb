<strong>WARNING: </strong> Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.8 operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime and other service products. Before performing the procedures in this topic, ensure that you have upgraded to ERT version 1.8 as described in <a href ="./upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. Only follow the procedure on this page for 1.8 product point releases.

This topic describes how to upgrade to a point release of Elastic Runtime (ERT) and other product tiles without upgrading Ops Manager. For example, use this topic to upgrade from ERT 1.8.0 to 1.8.1. You might need to do this upgrade if a security update for ERT is released or if new features are introduced in a point release of a product tile.

##<a id="other-products"></a>Upgrading PCF Products ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the <a href="../customizing/add-delete.html#pivnet-api">Pivotal Network API</a>, the latest product versions will automatically appear in your <strong>Installation Dashboard</strong>.</p>

This section describes how to upgrade individual products like [Single Sign-On for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html),
 [MySQL for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html), or [RabbitMQ&reg; for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html) in your [Metrics for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-metrics/index.html) (PCF) deployment. Ensure you review the individual product upgrade procedure for each tile. 

1. Browse to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) and sign in.

1. Download the latest PCF release for the product or products you want
to upgrade. Every product is tied to exactly one stemcell. Download the stemcell that matches your product and version.

1. Browse to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager web interface and click **Import a Product**.

1. Select the .pivotal file that you downloaded from Pivotal Network or received from your software distributor, then click Open. If the product is successfully added, it appears in the your product list. If the product you selected is not the latest version, the most up-to-date version will appear on your product list.

1. Click the plus icon next to the product description to add the product tile to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Repeat the import, upload, and upgrade steps for each product you
downloaded.

1. If you are upgrading a product that uses a self-signed certificate from version 1.1 to 1.2, you must configure the product to trust the self-signed certificate.

    To do this:
    * Click the product tile.
    * In the left-hand column, select the setting page containing the SSL
    certificate configuration. For example, for Elastic Runtime, select
    the **HAProxy** page.
    * Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box.
    * Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

##<a id="after-products"></a>After You Upgrade ##

* The `collector` job which was used to retrieve logs from Elastic Runtime components is removed in 1.8. Metrics are now emitted using Metron/Firehose rather than variables. After you complete the upgrade to Ops Manager version 1.8, you can scale this job to `0` by navigating to **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** >> **Resource Config**.
