This topic describes how to upgrade Elastic Runtime (ERT) and other product tiles alone, without upgrading Ops Manager. For example, you might need to do this if a security update for ERT is released or if new features are introduced in a point release of a product tile.

The topic [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./upgrading-pcf.html) describes how to perform a complete upgrade of PCF, including Ops Manager, ERT and other installed products.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong> Before you upgrade to Elastic Runtime 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. All apps that do not already run on Diego will terminate during an upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.</p>

## <a id="runtime_upgrade"></a>Upgrading Elastic Runtime

Refer to the [Product Version Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf) before upgrading Elastic Runtime for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you upgrade to Ops Manager 1.7.x, you must first upgrade PCF Elastic Runtime to version 1.6.9 or higher. </p>

### Install using the Pivotal Operations Manager

To install Elastic Runtime for PCF without upgrading Ops Manager, follow the procedure for installing PCF products:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).
1. Upload the product file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the Available Products view to add this product to your staging area.
1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options.
1. Click **Apply Changes** to install the service.

##<a id="before-products"></a>Before You Upgrade ##

Before you upgrade to Elastic Runtime 1.7, you must migrate all apps that are currently running on DEA architecture to run on Diego architecture. Pivotal does not support DEA architecture in Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7. See the [Migrating Apps to Diego](../adminguide/apps-enable-diego.html) topic for information.

##<a id="other-products"></a>Upgrading PCF Products ##

**Important**: Read the Known Issues section of the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) before getting started.

This section describes how to upgrade individual products like Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime,
[Pivotal MySQL](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql), or [RabbitMQ](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service) in your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In Ops Manager 1.7, all product tiles use floating stemcells by default. This increases the security of your deployment by enabling tiles to automatically use the latest patched version of a stemcell, but it may significantly increase the amount of time required by a tile upgrade. Review the <a href="understanding-stemcells.html">Understanding Floating Stemcells</a> topic for more information.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To upgrade your PCF product to a target release, you must install all releases from your currently deployed version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Elastic Runtime release 1.5 and you are upgrading to 1.7, you must sequentially install 1.6 and 1.7.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html">The Single Sign-On service tile</a> operates in lockstep with Pivotal Elastic Runtime.
    <ul><li> The SSO v1.0.x tiles are compatible with PCF v1.6.x </li>
    <li> The SSO v1.1.x tiles are compatible with PCF v1.7.x </li></ul>
If you are a customer upgrading from PCF 1.6 to PCF 1.7 and you are using SSO v1.0.x, you must update SSO v1.1.0 service tile at the same time with the ERT upgrade.</div>

1. Browse to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) and sign in.

1. Download the latest PCF release for the product or products you want
to upgrade. Every product is tied to exactly one stemcell. Download the stemcell that matches your product and version.

1. <%= partial "check_disk_before_upgrade" %>

1. Browse to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager web interface and click **Import a Product**.

    <%= image_tag("import.png") %>

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As of release 1.4.0.0, Pivotal Ops Manager no longer supports older versions of PCF products. You must update all products to at least version 1.2 (except for RabbitMQ, which must be updated to at least version 1.3.4.0) before importing them into Ops Manager 1.4.0.0.
	</p>

1. Upload the new version of a product you want to upgrade.

1. Under **Available Products**, click **Upgrade** for the uploaded product.

1. Repeat the import, upload, and upgrade steps for each product you
downloaded.

1. If you are upgrading a product that uses a self-signed certificate from version 1.1 to 1.2, you must configure the product to trust the self-signed certificate.

    To do this:
    * Click the product tile.
    * In the left-hand column, select the setting page containing the SSL
    certificate configuration. For example, for Elastic Runtime, select
    the **HAProxy** page.
    * Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box.
    * Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

##<a id="after-products"></a>After You Upgrade ##

* Advise your application developers about the Diego architecture. See the [Migrating Apps to Diego](../adminguide/apps-enable-diego.html) and the [Diego Architecture](./../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html) topics for more information.


* Ops Manager 1.7 defines specific instance types instead of custom sizes for vSphere or vCloud. Each instance adopts an instance type that is the closest match to its previous custom size for CPU, memory, and disk space. You can modify the automatically selected instance size by selecting a different <code>type</code> under <strong>Resource Config</strong> for each of your installed tiles.
