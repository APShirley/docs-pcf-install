1. Under **Available Products**, click **Upgrade** for the uploaded product.

1. Repeat the import, upload, and **Upgrade** steps for each product you

    * In the left-hand column, select the setting page containing the SSL
    certificate configuration. For example, for Elastic Runtime, select
    the **HA Proxy** page.
    * Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box. 
    * Click **Save**.
