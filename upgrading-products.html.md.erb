1. If you are upgrading a product that uses a self-signed certificate from version 1.1 to 1.2, you must configure the product to trust the self-signed certificate.

    To do this:
    * Click the product tile.
    * In the left-hand column, select the setting containing the SSL
    certificate configuration page. For example, for Elastic Runtime, select
    **HA Proxy**.
    * Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** box. Click **Save**.
