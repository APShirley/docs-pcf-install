This topic requires you to run commands from the [Ops Manager Director](./../customizing/index.html) using the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI).

There are two major releases of the BOSH CLI, and the Ops Manager Director VM includes both versions.
You can use either version of the BOSH CLI to interact with your deployment, using
`bosh` commands for the old CLI and `bosh2` commands for the new CLI.

For more information about the differences between the old and new versions of the BOSH CLI, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-diff.html).

This topic provides example commands for both versions of the BOSH CLI.
Pivotal recommends using `bosh2` for compatibility with future PCF versions.

See [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](./../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare) for more information.
