title: Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a C2S Environment
---

## <a id="background"></a>Background ##

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry &reg;](PCF) on Cloud Computing Services (C2S) using the PCF CloudFormation template.

The goal of this document is to offer operators within critical government organizations hands-on, step-by-step technical documentation to implement an end-to-end automated solution to deploying an offline Pivotal Cloud Foundry(PCF) to C2S. 

This document specifically addresses the need for a continuous deployment, continuous integration pipeline of reliable, integration-tested Cloud Foundry deployments which can be operated in a secure environment.

Pivotal recommends the specific course of action described herein based on the following assumptions: 

- That a small team, typically two operators, can deploy, troubleshoot and maintain an entire Cloud Foundry environment which supports thousands of servers and applications; 
- That the normal release cycle of Pivotal Cloud Foundry’s cf-release provides the most reliable and stable cloud environment possible, leveraging the entire Pivotal Cloud Operations and Engineering teams’ expertise in running the cutting edge Pivotal Web Services, which remains several release versions ahead of cf-release and, therefore, acts as its integration testing suite;
- That clients require the ability to start with one data image, for example an Amazon Machine Image, securely scan that image, and deploy their entire Cloud Foundry from those contents, in an automated fashion, and in an offline, secure environment.

<!-- Should we mention some of the 12 (or 14) core requirements for this POC as well? -->

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The use of the term Amazon Web Services (AWS) also refers to the C2S environment throughout this document.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites ##

You must have the following in order to follow the procedure described here:

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you will not have online access while installing PCF, make sure you can complete the prerequisites below without documentation. </p>

* An AWS account that can accomodate the minimum resource requirements for a PCF installation:
    * 1 Elastic Load Balancer
    * 1 Relational Database Service. We recommend at least a db.m3.large instance with 100 GB of allocated storage.
    * 2 S3 Buckets
    * EC2 Instances:
        * 10 t2.micros
        * 1 r3.xlarge (1 per DEA)
        * 1 c4.xlarge
        * 2 m3.large

* The appropriate region selected within your AWS account. See the [Amazon documentation on regions and availability zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones) for help selecting the correct region for your deployment.
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine, and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits (or no instance limits) on your AWS account. Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances (how many?? Where is this checked?).
* A key pair to use with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. [Create a key pair in AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation. You will need this registered domain when configuring your SSL certificate and Cloud Controller.
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed cert, but Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate only for testing and development. You should obtain a cert from your Certificate Authority for use in your production environment.
