1. From the offline Ops Manager, upload the releases and stemcells for the PCF installation:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-mysql-23.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-222.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/diego-0.1437.0.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/etcd-release-16.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-console-release-console-du-jour-203.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-apps-manager-release-397.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-19.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-ui-10.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-autoscaling-28.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/strongswan-0.1-beta.tgz --skip-if-exists

$ bosh -n upload stemcell /opt/artifacts/stemcells/bosh-stemcell-3112-aws-xen-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
</pre>

1. Modify the following parameters as necessary in the Cloud Foundry Deployment Manifest YAML file in the deployments directory on the offline Ops Manager for the environment:
  1. Director UUID (using <BOSH-STATUS> above)
  1. Network Cloud Properties, Subnet-ID: (pcf-private-subnet, AWS Console: VPC)
  1. DNS settings.  Domain: chiron.vi-works.io.  Configure URLs (except Support) to use this domain.
