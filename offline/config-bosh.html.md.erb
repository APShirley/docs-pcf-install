title: Prepare BOSH for PCF Install
---

1. From the Jumpbox, upload the releases and stemcells for the PCF installation:
<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-mysql-20.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-208.13.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-console-release-console-du-jour-203.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-with-ui-18.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-autoscaling-13.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/strongswan-0.1-beta.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload stemcell /opt/artifacts/stemcells/bosh-stemcell-3094-aws-xen-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
</pre>

1. Modify the following parameters as necessary in the CloudFoundry Deployment Manifest `cf-chiron.yml` file in the deployments directory on the Jumpbox for the environment:
  * Director UUID (using <bosh status> above)
  * Network Cloud Properties, Subnet-ID: (pcf-private-subnet, AWS Console: VPC)
  * DNS settings.  Domain: chiron.vi-works.io.  Configure URLs (except Support) to use this domain.

1. Convert CloudFoundry Deployment Manifest to use IPSec using ipsec-transformer:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ipsec-transformer &#60; cf-chiron.yml > cf-chiron-with-ipsec.yml
</pre>
