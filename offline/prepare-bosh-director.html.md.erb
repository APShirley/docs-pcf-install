---

This topic describes a subset of the steps to install an [offline Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](./install-pws-dark.html).

1. From the offline Ops Manager, upload the releases and stemcells for the PCF installation:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-mysql-20.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-208.13.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-console-release-console-du-jour-203.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-with-ui-18.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-autoscaling-13.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload stemcell /opt/artifacts/stemcells/bosh-stemcell-3094-aws-xen-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
</pre>

1. Copy and modify the [CloudFoundry Deployment Manifest](https://github.com/pivotal-federal-field-engineering/deployment-manifests/blob/master/cf/cf-manifest.yml "Manifest"): cf-manifest.yml into the deployment directory on the offline Ops Manager.
<pre class="terminal">
$ scp -i bosh.pem cf-manifest.yml ubuntu@<public-dns-name>:~/deployments
</pre>

1. Modify the following parameters:

    1. Director UUID (using <bosh status> above)

    1. Network Cloud Properties, Subnet-ID: (pcf-private-subnet, AWS Console: VPC)

    1. DNS settings.  Domain: chiron.vi-works.io.  Configure URLs (except Support) to use this domain.
