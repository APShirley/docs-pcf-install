This topic describes a subset of the steps to install an [offline Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](./install-pws-dark.html).

1. From the offline Ops Manager, upload the releases and stemcells for the PCF installation:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-mysql-23.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-222.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/diego-0.1437.0.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/etcd-release-16.tgz --skip-if-exists
