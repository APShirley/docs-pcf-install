---

This topic describes a subset of the steps to install an [offline Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](./install-pws-dark.html).

1. From the offline Ops Manager, upload the releases and stemcells for the PCF installation:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-mysql-23.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-222.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/diego-0.1437.0.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/etcd-release-16.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-console-release-console-du-jour-203.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/push-apps-manager-release-397.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-19.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/notifications-ui-10.tgz --skip-if-exists
$ bosh -n upload release /opt/artifacts/releases/cf-autoscaling-28.tgz --skip-if-exists

</pre>

1. Modify the [CloudFoundry Deployment Manifest](https://github.com/pivotal-federal-field-engineering/dark-chiron-aws/tree/master/deployments/cf-chiron.yml "Manifest"): cf-chiron.yml, or the appropriate YAML for your repo, in the deployments directory on the offline Ops Manager.

1. Modify the following parameters:

    1. Director UUID: VALUE-SAVED-FROM-BOSH.YML

    1. Network Cloud Properties:
    	1. **Subnet-ID**: PCF-PRIVATE-SUBNET
    	1. **AWS-CONSOLE**: VPC

    1. DNS settings:  
    	1. **Domain**: HOST.YOUR-DOMAIN.GOV
