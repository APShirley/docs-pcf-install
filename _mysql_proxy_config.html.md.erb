(**Optional**) Select **MySQL Proxy Config**. Enter one or more IP addresses for the MySQL proxy instances configured on your external load balancer. Enter the hostname you configured with your MySQL Service. <br><br>Use of a proxy permits transparent failover to other nodes within the cluster in the event of a node failure. When a node becomes unhealthy, the proxy re-routes all subsequent connections to a healthy node and all existing connections to the unhealthy node are closed. See [MySQL for PCF: Proxy](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html#proxy) for more information.
