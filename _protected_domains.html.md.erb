If your PCF deployment uses HAProxy and you want it to receive traffic only from specific sources, use the following fields:
	* **Protected Domains**: Enter a comma-separated list of domains from which PCF can receive traffic. 
	* **Trusted CIDRs**: Optionally, enter a space-separated list of CIDRs to limit which IP addresses from the **Protected Domains** can send traffic to PCF.
