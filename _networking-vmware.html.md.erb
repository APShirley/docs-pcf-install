1. For **Router IPs**, enter one or more static IP addresses for your routers. These must be in the subnet that you configured in the Ops Manager **Create Networks** section.

If you are using the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), add the name of your ELB in the router column of the **Resource Config** section.

1. For **HAProxy IPs**, enter one or more IP addresses for HAProxy. You must point your DNS to this IP unless you are using your own load balancer, and HAProxy's IP must be in your subnet.
