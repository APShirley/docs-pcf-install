The **Advanced Features** section of Elastic Runtime includes a checkbox that disables using Consul as a distributed locking system.

In previous versions of PCF, Consul performed service discovery and provided a distributed locking system. In PCF 1.11, Consul continues to perform service discovery but PCF deploys a new distributed locking system called Locket alongside Consul.

In a fresh install, Consul is disabled by default as the distributed locking system and Locket is enabled. In upgrades, however, operators must disable Consul locks manually to ensure that Locket is the only component that handles distributed locking.

Ensure that **Skip Consul Locks** is selected to disable using Consul as a distributed locking system.
