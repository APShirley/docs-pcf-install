## <a id='install'></a>Troubleshooting Pivotal CF Installations ##

If you encounter a problem during a Pivotal CF install, the following list of troubleshooting measures can help you diagnose and resolve issues. These measures are outlined in more detail below. In particular, BOSH includes helpful diagnostic tools. For an overview and more information about BOSH, refer to the BOSH documentation.

## <a id='access_bosh'></a>Step 1: Access the BOSH director ##

1. Either SSH to the Pivotal CF installation VM or access it using the vSphere console.

1. Log in using the credentials you provided when you imported the Pivotal CF .ova in vCenter.

1. Run `cd /home/tempest-web/tempest/web/`.

1. Run `export BUNDLE_GEMFILE=/home/tempest-web/tempest/web/bosh.Gemfile`, OR prepend `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=./bosh.Gemfile` to all of your BOSH commands.

1. Run `bundle exec bosh target <IP_OF_YOUR_DIRECTOR>`.

 **Note**: Refer to the **Status** tab of the **vmware vSphere** tile to find the IP of your BOSH director.

1. Run `bundle exec bosh login`. Use the BOSH director credentials to log in.

 **Note**: Refer to the **Credentials** tab of the **vmware vSphere** tile to find the BOSH director credentials.

1. Run `bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/cf-******.yml`, where the wildcard represents a unique ID the installation generates. To find the unique ID, click the VMware vSphere tile, select the **Resource sizes** tab, and look at the address. The ID appears as a string of numbers and letters after `microbosh-`.

 **Note**: If you are working in the MySQL product context, use `cf_services-******.yml` instead. You can find the unique ID for MySQL from the MySQL Dev product tile by following the steps above.

### <a id='reference'></a>Locating reference files ###

After you SSH into the Pivotal CF installation VM, you have access to reference files that may help you diagnose issues with the Pivotal CF install.

 * **Pivotal CF config files**: The Pivotal CF configuration is stored in `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/config.yml`. The configuration data is stored in an encrypted form, so you can't edit it directly. However, you can delete this file if you need to start over with a fresh Pivotal CF install.

 * **BOSH installation failure logs**: Logs from the BOSH installation are stored in `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/micro`.

## <a id='bosh_cli'></a>Step 2: Try relevant BOSH CLI commands ##

### <a id='bosh_cck'></a>bosh cck (bosh cloudcheck) ###

This command attempts to detect any differences between the world the director expects for this deployment and the actual state of the world. For each difference it detects, `bosh cck` offers a potential resolution. The possible resolutions are listed below:

#### <a id='unresponsive_agent'></a>Unresponsive Agent ####

 Example`bosh cck` output:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh cck
ccdb/0 (vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a) is not responding:

- Ignore problem
- Reboot VM
- Recreate VM using last known apply spec
- Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>



- `Ignore problem`: Do nothing. You might want to ignore the problem in order to run `bosh ssh` and attempt troubleshooting on the machine. If performing other steps continually brings the machine to this state, you could have a configuration problem that will be hard to detect without looking at the agent logs.
- `Reboot VM`: **In most cases, try this first**. The error could be transient.
- `Recreate VM using last known apply spec` - Destroy the server and have BOSH recreate it from the deployment manifest the installer provides. If the machine is corrupted, this is the best option.
- `Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)` - Select this option only if you know that the BOSH database has a stale reference causing it to expect that an agent should be running on this machine. Once you delete the VM reference, you can no longer control the machine using BOSH.

#### <a id='missing_vm'></a>Missing VM ####

Example `bosh cck` output:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh cck
VM with cloud ID `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' missing:

- Ignore problem
- Recreate VM using last known apply spec
- Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)
</pre>

- `Ignore problem`: Do nothing. You might want to ignore the problem in order to run `bosh ssh` and attempt troubleshooting on the machine. If performing other steps continually brings the machine to this state, you could have a configuration problem that will be hard to detect without looking at the agent logs.
- `Recreate VM using last known apply spec` - Destroy the server and have BOSH recreate it from the deployment manifest the installer provides. If the machine is corrupted, this is the best option.
- `Delete VM reference (DANGEROUS!)` - Select this option only if you know that the BOSH database has a stale reference causing it to expect that an agent should be running on this machine. Once you delete the VM reference, you can no longer control the machine using BOSH.

#### <a id='unbound_instancevm'></a>Unbound Instance VM ####

Example `bosh cck` output:

<pre class="terminal">
	$bosh cck
	VM `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' reports itself as `ccdb/0' but does not have a bound instance:

	- Ignore problem
	- Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)
	- Reassociate VM with corresponding instance
</pre>

 - `Ignore problem`: Do nothing. You might want to ignore the problem in order to `bosh ssh` and attempt troubleshooting on the machine. If performing other steps continually brings the machine to this state, you could have a configuration problem that will be hard to detect without looking at the agent logs.
 - `Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)`: If you believe that the VM is associated with a job erroneously, this is a good option.
 - `Reassociate VM with corresponding instance`: If you believe that the VM is correctly associated with the job, and that the BOSH DB is in error, this is a good option.

#### <a id='out_of_sync'></a>Out of Sync VM ####

Example `bosh cck` output:

<pre class="terminal">
VM `vm-3e37133c-bc33-450e-98b1-f86d5b63502a' is out of sync: expected `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: ccdb/0', got `cf-d7293430724a2c421061: nats/0':

- Ignore problem
- Delete VM (unless it has persistent disk)
</pre>

### <a id='bosh_vms'></a>bosh vms ###

This command provides an overview of the virtual machines BOSH is managing as part of the current deployment. When you are experiencing issues, `bosh vms` may show you VMs in an `unknown` state. If that happens, run `bosh cck` to attempt to diagnose the problem.

Additionally, you can use `bosh vms` to identify which VMs are available for you to `bosh ssh` into for further troubleshooting.

You can also run this command with arguments to retrieve additional information:

 - `--details`: Returns detailed VM information (Cloud ID, Agent ID, Resurrection Enabled?)

 - `--vitals`: Returns VM vitals information (Load, CPU, Memory Usage, Swap Usage, Disk Usage)

Refer to the **Status** tab of the **Elastic Runtime** product tile to view information similar to the `bosh vms` output.

### <a id='bosh_ssh'></a>bosh ssh ###

This command simplifies the process of accessing the VM using SSH. `bosh ssh` also gives you `sudo` access.

To use `bosh ssh`:

1. Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to provide BOSH with the correct public key.

1. Accept the defaults.

1. Run `bosh ssh dea/0 --public_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to SSH into the first DEA machine. To SSH into a different machine, substitute the coordinates you retrieve from `bosh vms`.

1. You are prompted to create a password for the temporary user `bosh ssh` creates. You will use temporary user later if you need to run `sudo -i`.

Pivotal CF saves the public key choice for subsequent executions of `bosh ssh`.
