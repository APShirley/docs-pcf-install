To add the cipher suite to the Gorouter cipher suites, add  `AES128-SHA256` (OpenSSL format) to the list of ciphers you specify in the **TLS Cipher Suites for Router** field of the **Networking** configuration screen of Elastic Runtime. For more information, see the Elastic Runtime configuration documentation for your IaaS. For example, if you are deploying PCF on GCP, then see [Deploying Elastic Runtime on GCP](../customizing/gcp-er-config.html).
