title: Using Your Own Load Balancer
---

Pivotal CF uses HAProxy as the default load balancer for SSL termination.
This guide describes how to use your own load balancer and forward traffic to
the Cloud Foundry router IP.

1. Deploy a Pivotal CF Installation virtual machine.
See [Deploying Operations Manager](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html) for
more information.

1. In your load balancer, register the IP addresses you assigned to Pivotal CF.

1. Set up your Pivotal Operations Manager and vSphere as described in [Getting Started with Pivotal CF](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/getstarted/index.html), but do not click
**Install**.

1. In Pivotal Operations Manager, click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

1. In the left column, select **HAProxy** if not already selected.

1. In the **HAProxy IPs** field, delete any existing IP addresses.
This field should be blank.

1. If you are using a signed certificate from a known certificate authority,
install the SSL Certificate on your load balancer.
If you are not using a signed certificate, generate a self-signed RSA certificate as described in [Generate an RSA Certificate](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/getstarted/index.html#generate_rsa_cert),
then install this certificate on your load balancer.

8. In the left column, select **Router IPs**.

1. In the **Router IPs** field, enter the IP address(es) for Pivotal CF that you registered with your load balancer in Step 2 . Save this change.

section of the Pivotal CF Getting Started Guide.
