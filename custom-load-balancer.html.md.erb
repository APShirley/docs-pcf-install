title: Using Your Own Load Balancer
---

This guide describes how to use your own load balancer and forward traffic to
your Elastic Runtime router IP address.

[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deploys with a single instance of HAProxy for use in lab and test
environments.
Production environments should use a highly-available customer-provided load
balancing solution that does the following:

* Provides load balancing to each of the PCF Router IPs
* Supports SSL termination with wildcard DNS location
* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers to
incoming requests
* (**Optional**) Supports WebSockets

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Application logging with <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html#loggregator">Loggregator</a> requires WebSockets. To use another logging service, see the <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html#use">Using Third-Party Log Management Services</a> topic.</p>

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites##

To integrate your own load balancer with PCF, you must ensure the following:

* WebSocket connections are not blocked for Loggregator functionality.
* The load balancer must be able to reach the gorouter IPs.

Follow the instructions below to use your own load balancer.

##<a id='deploy'></a>Step 1: Deploy PCF Installation VM##

Deploy a PCF Installation virtual machine.
The procedure you follow depends on the IaaS you use:

* [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../customizing/deploying-vm.html)
* [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](../customizing/pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)

##<a id='register'></a>Step 2: Register PCF IP Address##

In your load balancer, register the IP addresses that you assigned to PCF.

##<a id='configure'></a>Step 3: Configure Pivotal Ops Manager and Ops Manager Director##

Configure your Pivotal Operations Manager and Ops Manager Director as
described in [Getting Started with Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../getstarted/index.html), then
add Elastic Runtime.

Do not click **Install** after adding Elastic Runtime.

## <a id='ips-and-ports'></a>Step 4: Configure IPs ##

1. In Pivotal Operations Manager, click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

1. In the left column, select **IPs and Ports** if not already selected.

1. In the **HAProxy IPs** field, delete any existing IP addresses.
This field should be blank.

1. Select **Router IPs**.

1. In the **Router IPs** field, enter the IP address or addresses for PCF that you registered with your load balancer in Step 2.
Save this change.

<%= partial 'security_config' %>

## <a id='finalize'></a>Step 6: Finalize Changes ##

1. Return to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**

1. Click **Install**.
