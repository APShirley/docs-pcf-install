This topic describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to v1.8. The upgrade procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager (Ops Manager), Pivotal Elastic Runtime, and product tiles.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong> Ops Manager operates in lockstep with Elastic Runtime and other service products. You must Review Product Compatibility Prerequisites below before proceeding with this upgrade procedure. Your upgrade will fail if you do not have compatible product versions associated with your Ops Manager installation.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.</p>

**Important**: Read the Known Issues section of the [Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) before getting started.

## <a id="beforeupgrade"></a>Before You Upgrade

<p class="note warning">This section contains important guidelines that you must follow before beginning an upgrade to Ops Manager v1.8. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data or cause your upgrade to fail.</p>

### <a id="review-lockstep"></a>Review Product Compatibility Prerequisites

* Before upgrading to Ops Manager v1.8, you must be on the following product versions. Download the compatible product versions on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/). 
    * Elastic Runtime v1.7.14 or higher 
    * RabbitMQ&reg; v1.6.5 or higher (if you are using this product) 
    
### <a id="prepare-env"></a>Prepare Your Environment

1. Install the releases from your currently deployed 
version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager v1.6 and you are upgrading to v1.8, 
you must sequentially install v1.7 and v1.8.

1. Back up all critical data prior to upgrading to Ops Manager v1.8. For example, to backup a v1.7 environment, follow these instructions <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf.html">Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>. 

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to backup the Apps Manager database since it is deprecated in 1.8. When the database is dropped during the upgrade, there will be data loss in the form of sent emails for users who are invited to join or create accounts on PCF. For example, this affects users who have an existing invitation to join PCF in their email inbox. The link to the invitation will no longer work.</p>

1. If you have disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product in order to reduce deployment time, Pivotal recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. See <a href="./add-delete.html#add-import">Adding and Deleting Products</a> for more  information.

1. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

1. Ensure that the VM Resurrector is turned off:
   1. From your Installation Dashboard, select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 
   2. Click **Director Config**.
   3. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
   4. Click **Save**.
   5. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.

1. If you are upgrading a vSphere environment, ensure that you have the following information about your existing environment before starting the upgrade:
  * Record these IP addresses, which can be found in the vSphere web client, **Manage** > **Settings** > **vApp Options**.
    This is the same information you entered at the end of deploying [Ops Manager on vSphere](http://docs.pivotal.io/1.6/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html). 
     * IP Address of the Ops Manager
     * Netmask
     * Default Gateway
     * DNS Servers
     * NTP Servers
  * Record this VM hardware information so you can set up the new VM with similar settings. You can find this in the vSphere web 
client, **Manage** > **Settings** > **VM Hardware**.
     * CPU
     * Memory
     * Hard Disk 1
     * Network Adapter 1 -- When you set up the new VM, ensure your network adapters are configured properly and are on the same network.


### <a id="check-health"></a>Check System Health Before Upgrade

1. Run `bosh cloudcheck` to confirm that the VMs are healthy.  See the [BOSH Cloudcheck](./trouble-advanced.html#cck) topic.

1. Check the system health of installed products. In the Installation Dashboard, select the **Status** tab for each service tile. Confirm that all jobs are healthy.

1. (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade.
See the [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view) topic.  

1. There should be no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be green.
Click **Apply Changes** if necessary.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    ```
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    ```

### <a id="keep"></a>Step 1: Export Your Installation ###

Follow the steps below to upgrade Ops Manager and installed products.

1. Before you export your installation settings, you must be using the following product versions. You can download the product versions on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/). 
    * Elastic Runtime v1.7.14 or higher  
    * RabbitMQ v1.6.5 or higher (if you are using this product)

    <p class="note warning">
    <strong>WARNING: </strong>You will not be able to complete the upgrade if you fail to upgrade your product versions before exporting your installation.</p>

1. <a name="export"></a> In your Ops Manager v1.7.x **Installation Dashboard**, click the gear icon and select **Export settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/upgrade_to_1.8.png") %>

    This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.
    When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images and
    necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
    As a result, an exported file can be very large, as much as 5 GB or more.
    * The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
    * Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export
      process, and might appear to hang.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some operating systems automatically unzip  the exported installation.
      If this occurs, create a zip file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the “installation” folder
      level.
      Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: 
      Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process,
      and might appear to hang.</p>

1. A "Successfully imported installation" message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>

### <a id="keep"></a>Step 3: Upgrade Products ###

1. <a name="success"></a>Now that you have successfully upgraded to Ops Manager 1.8, in order to complete your installation, you must upgrade your product versions. If you use the following products, you must upgrade them to the versions specified below. Download the compatible product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).
    * Elastic Runtime v1.8.x

## <a id="after"></a>After Completing Your Upgrade ##

### <a id="after-ert"></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

* The `collector` job which was used to retrieve logs from Elastic Runtime components is removed in v1.8. Metrics are now emitted using Metron/Firehose rather than variables. After you complete the upgrade to Ops Manager v1.8, scale this job by navigating to **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** >> **Resource Config**. Change the number of instances to `0`.
