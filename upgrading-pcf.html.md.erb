title: Upgrading Operations Manager
---

**Important**: Read the Known Issues section of the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry
Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) before getting started.

Complete the following steps to upgrade Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations
Manager.
Select the procedure that corresponds to your upgrading scenario.

Pivotal strongly recommends that you [back up all critical data](./backup-restore/backup-pcf.html) prior to upgrading.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To upgrade your <a
  href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud
  Foundry</a> (PCF) installation to a target release, you must install all
  releases from your currently deployed version to the target version in
  sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager release 1.1
  and you are upgrading to 1.3, you must sequentially install 1.2 and 1.3.</p>

## <a id="pcf16upgrade"></a>Upgrading to PCF 1.6

This section contains important guidelines that you must follow if you upgrade an existing PCF 1.5 deployment to PCF 1.6. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data or cause your upgrade to fail.

### Before You Upgrade ###

* Delete the Diego BETA tile if you have it installed.

* In **Resource Config** of your existing Elastic Runtime 1.5 configuration, scale the number of consul servers down to **1** instance. You can scale the number back up after you have upgraded the Elastic Runtime. If you are not running any consul servers as part of your deployment, you can ignore this step.

* If you are upgrading PCF on AWS, create and configure an ELB for enabling Diego SSH connections. See [Creating an SSH Proxy for Diego with an AWS ELB](cloudform_elb_ssh_proxy.html) for instructions.

### During the Elastic Runtime Upgrade ###

* If your PCF 1.5 deployment uses internal databases, do not modify the selected Postgres/MySQL configuration on the **System Database Config** page. PCF 1.6 allows you to deploy all your internal databases to MySQL for improved high-availability. Only select the MySQL only option after you have migrated all your Postgres data. If you wish to migrate your data in order to access this feature in PCF 1.6, please contact Pivotal support first.

* If your PCF 1.5 deployment uses an external S3 filestore, do not modify the prepopulated value used for the bucket name fields on the **File Storage Config** page. PCF 1.6 allows you to specify four different buckets for various cloud-controller artifacts. You should continue to use your existing 1.5 bucket name across all four buckets in order not to lose existing data.

* If you wish to make [Diego](/concepts/diego-architecture.html) the default for all new applications pushed to your PCF 1.6 deployment, select **Use Diego by default instead of DEAs** on the **Diego configuration screen**. If you do not select this option, application developers must specify Diego explicitly when pushing their applications to access Diego features. See Diego Migration.

### After the Upgrade ###

* In **Resource Config** scale your consul server instances back up to the desired number.

* Advise your application developers on how to target Diego when pushing their applications. See Diego Migration.

## <a id="keep"></a>Upgrading with Installed Products ##

Follow these steps to keep all installed products when you upgrade Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have disabled lifecycle errands
	for any installed product in order to reduce deployment time, Pivotal
	recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. See <a
	href="./add-delete.html#add-import">Adding and Deleting Products</a> for more
	information. </p>
1. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>
1. Ensure that every product tile on the Installation Dashboard is compatible
with the new version of Ops Manager.
To be compatible, a product must meet the minimum version requirement for that
product.
If a product does not meet this requirement, you must upgrade the product or
remove the tile before upgrading Ops Manager.
    <br /><br />
    For specific compatibility information, refer to the full [Product Version  Matrix](../../compatibility-matrix.pdf).

1. From the Product Dashboard, select **Actions > Export installation 
settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/export_settings.png") %>

    This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.
    When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images and
    necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
    As a result, an exported file can be very large, as much as 5 GB or more.
    * Because of the size of the exported file, exporting can take tens of
      minutes.
    * Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export
      process, and may appear to hang.
    * Some operating systems may automatically unzip the exported installation.
      If this occurs, create a zip file of the unzipped export.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a zip file of an
      unzipped export, do not start compressing at the “installation” folder
      level.
      Instead, start compressing at the level containing the config.yml:</p>

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

1. Download the latest Ops Manager VM Template from the [Pivotal
Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) site.

1. Record the IP address of the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. To avoid IP conflicts, power off the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM.
See [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html) or [Deploying
Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html).

1. From the Product Dashboard, select **Actions > Import installation
settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/import_settings.png") %>

1. Click **Choose File**, browse to the installation zip file exported in Step
1, and click **Choose**.
1. If the admin password has changed since the file was exported, you must
select **Need to enter a decryption password?** before you click **Import** to
prevent an error.
Enter the original password that was used when the installation was exported.
If the admin password has not changed, you may skip this step.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/import.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Importing can take tens of minutes.
      Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process,
      and may appear to hang.</p>

1. A "Successfully imported installation" message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Change the value of the **Ephemeral Disk (MB)** for the Ops Manager Director
to `32768`.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/opsmgr-resources.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. This immediately imports and applies upgrades to all tiles in a single transaction.

1. Click each service tile, select the **Status** tab, and confirm that all VMs appear and are in good health.

1. Remove the original Ops Manager VM from AWS if the new installation functions
correctly.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Independently from upgrading Ops Manager,
  you can upgrade individual products such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic
  Runtime, <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql">Pivotal
  MySQL</a>, or <a
href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service">RabbitMQ</a>
  in your PCF deployment. See <a href="./upgrading-products.html">Upgrading
  Products in a PCF Deployment</a>.</p>

## <a id="lose"></a>Uninstalling and Reinstalling Ops Manager ##

Follow these steps to upgrade Ops Manager if you have no installed products, or
you have no installed products that you want to keep.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to reinstall Ops Manager, and
  would like to import your information to the new installation, you will need
  the exported Cloud Controller database and the configuration from the previous
  installation.</p>

1. Browse to the Ops Manager web interface and select **Delete this
installation**.

1. In vSphere, vCloud Air, or vCloud, power off and delete your existing Ops
Manager VM.

1. Download the latest Ops Manager VM Template from the [Pivotal
Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) site.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM.
See one of the following topics:
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)
    * [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and
      vCloud](./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)

## <a id="rollback"></a>Rolling Back an Upgraded Installation ##

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To roll back an installation, or if
  upgrading fails, Pivotal recommends that you contact Pivotal Support.</p>

If you want to roll back or troubleshoot a failed installation on your own,
consult the table below.
The table shows guidelines for compatibility between your exported configuration
and available Ops Manager versions.
