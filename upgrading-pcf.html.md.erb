This topic describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to v1.9. The upgrade procedure below describes upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager (Ops Manager), Pivotal Elastic Runtime, and product tiles.

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

**Important**: Read the [Release Notes](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) for this release including Known Issues sections before getting started.

## <a id="beforeupgrade"></a>Before You Upgrade

This section contains important guidelines that you must follow before beginning an upgrade to Ops Manager v1.9. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause your upgrade to fail.

### <a id="review-lockstep"></a>Preparation Step 1: Verify App Usage Service Remedial Steps

If you are upgrading from a PCF deployment that at one point included Elastic Runtime v1.7.16 or earlier, <i>make sure</i> that you have performed the remedial steps outlined in <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/228639827-App-Usage-Data-and-Events-Data-Becomes-Corrupted-After-Upgrade-or-Install">App Usage Data and Events Data Become Corrupted After Upgrade or Install</a> before proceeding with this upgrade.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you fail to perform the remedial steps for this issue, this upgrade process may corrupt your existing usage data.</p>

### <a id="remove-products"></a>Preparation Step 2: Review and Remove Unsupported Products

If your deployment contains any of the following unsupported products, you must remove the associated product tile before upgrading. The following products are no longer maintained and are not currently compatible with PCF v1.9:

  * App Distribution for PCF
  * Data Sync for PCF
  * Datastax Enterprise for PCF
  * MongoDB for PCF
  * Neo4J for PCF
  * Pivotal HD
  * Session State Caching Powered by GemFire for PCF 
  * Riak CS for PCF

Failure to remove these products prior to upgrade may cause your issues with your deployment.

### <a id="review-partners"></a>Preparation Step 3: Review Partner Service Tiles

Some partner service tiles may currently be incompatible with PCF v1.9. Pivotal is working with partners to ensure their tiles are being updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For information about which partner service releases are currently compatible with PCF v1.9, review the appropriate partners services release documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

### <a id="download-targets"></a>Preparation Step 4: Download Upgrade Versions

To minimize disruptions to your deployment during the upgrade and satisfy simultaneous upgrade requirements, download the correct version of the product files you wish to upgrade from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/). If you are using any of the following products, download the following versions:

* Elastic Runtime v1.9.x
* RabbitMQ for PCF v1.7.x
* Single Sign-On Service v1.2.x
* PCF Metrics v1.2.x

### <a id="prepare-env"></a>Preparation Step 5: Prepare Your Environment

1. Install the releases from your currently deployed version to the target version in sequential order. For example, if your deployment uses Ops Manager v1.6 and you are upgrading to v1.9, you must sequentially install v1.7 and v1.8 before proceeding with the upgrade to v1.9.

1. Back up all critical data prior to upgrading to Ops Manager v1.9. For example, to backup a v1.8 environment, follow the instructions in the v1.8 <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf.html">Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> topic. 

1. If you have disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, Pivotal recommends that you re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the <a href="./add-delete.html#add-import">Adding and Deleting Products</a> topic.

1. If you have experimented with the Cloud Controller v3 API prior to this release, Pivotal recommends that you remove all existing v3 service bindings. The migration to PCF v1.9 removes all experimental v3 data. In addition, although existing v2 applications still run normally during the upgrade, some developer interacions with PCF such as pushing apps to PCF may fail. You may want to warn users about potential availability issues during the upgrade window.  

1. <%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

1. If not already disabled, disable the VM Resurrector:
   1. From your **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 
   2. Click **Director Config**.
   3. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
   4. Click **Save**.
   5. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.

1. If you are upgrading a vSphere environment, ensure that you have the following information about your existing environment before starting the upgrade:
  * Record the following IP addresses, which can be found in the vSphere web client, **Manage** > **Settings** > **vApp Options**. 
This is the same information you entered at the end of deploying [Ops Manager on vSphere](./deploying-vm.html). 
     * IP Address of the Ops Manager
     * Netmask
     * Default Gateway
     * DNS Servers
     * NTP Servers
  * Record the following VM hardware information so you can set up the new VM with similar settings. 
You can find this information in the vSphere web client under **Manage** > **Settings** > **VM Hardware**.
       * CPU
       * Memory
       * Hard Disk 1
       * Network Adapter 1 â€” When you set up the new VM, ensure your network adapters are configured properly and are on the same network.

### <a id="check-health"></a>Preparation Step 6: Check System Health Before Upgrade

1. Run `bosh cloudcheck` to confirm that the VMs are healthy. For more information, see the [BOSH Cloudcheck](./trouble-advanced.html#cck) topic.

1. Check the system health of installed products. In the **Installation Dashboard**, select the **Status** tab for each service tile. 
Confirm that all jobs are healthy.

1. (Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade.
For more information, see the [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view) topic.  

1. There should be no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be green.
Click **Apply Changes** if necessary. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>

### <a id="export"></a>Step 1: Export Your Installation ###

1. Make sure you have removed any tiles that are no longer supported. For the list of tiles, see [Review and Remove Unsupported Products](#remove-products).

1. In your Ops Manager v1.8.x **Installation Dashboard**, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/upgrade_to_1.9.png") %>

1. On the **Settings** screen, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, and click the **Export Installation Settings** button.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/export_install_settings.png") %>

    This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.<br/><br/>
    When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images and
    necessary packages and references to the installation IP addresses.
    As a result, an exported file can be very large, 5 GB or more.
    * The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
    * Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export
      process and might appear to hang.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/compress.png") %>

### <a id="upgrade"></a>Step 2: Upgrade to Ops Manager v1.9 ###

1. Download the Ops Manager VM Template v1.9.x from the [Pivotal
Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) site.

1. Record the FQDN address of the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. To avoid conflicts, power off the existing Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the new Ops Manager VM by following the steps in one of these topics:
    * **AWS**: [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on AWS](./cloudform-om-deploy.html)
    * **Azure**: [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](./azure-arm-template.html)
    * **GCP**: [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](./gcp-om-deploy.html)

    * **vSphere**: [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)

1. When redirected to the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, select **Import Existing Installation**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

1. When prompted, enter a Decryption Passphrase. Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation ZIP file exported in [Step 1](#export) above.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
      Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process,
      and might appear to hang.</p>

1. A "Successfully imported installation" message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrading/success.png") %>


### <a id="upgrade_products"></a>Step 3: Upgrade Elastic Runtime and Product Tiles
