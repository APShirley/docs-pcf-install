This topic covers monitoring Pivotal CF essentials and suggestions.

## <a id="interface"></a>Monitoring VMs Using the Ops Manager Interface ##

Click on any product tile, then select the **Status** tab to view monitoring
information.
Each job represents a component running on a VM deployed by Ops Manager.

 <%= image_tag("status-tab.png") %>

In particular, note the following columns:

* **CID**: Uniquely identifies the VM.
* **Load Avg15**: CPU load average over 15 minutes.
* **Ephem. Disk**: Ephermeral disk space usage.
* **Pers. Disk**: Persistent disk space usage.

Monitoring disk space usage for the Operations Manager VM and the NFS Server VM
is particularly important.

### <a id="ops-manager"></a>Operations Manager VM Disk Space ###

The Operations Manager VM is the VM where the Ops Manager web application runs.

The Operations Manager VM stores its logs in a directory named `/tmp`.
Over time, the logs can get big enough to cause the VM to run out of disk
space.
To prevent the VM from running out of disk space, restart the VM to clear the
log entries out of `/tmp`.

### <a id="nfs"></a>NFS Server VM Disk Space ###

The NFS Server VM is the blob store where Elastic Runtime uploads applications.
The default size of the blob store is 100 Gigabytes.

If the NFS Server VM is low on available disk space:

1. In Ops Manager, click the **Pivotal Elastic Runtime** tile.

1. Select the **Status** tab.

1. On the **Settings** tab, select **Resource sizes**.

1. Allocate more disk space to the NFS Server VM.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

## <a id="vsphere"></a>Monitoring in vSphere ##

VMware vSphere Server provides alarms that monitor VMs, as well as clusters,
hosts, datacenters, datastores, networks, and licensing.
To view preconfigured alarms, including disk usage alarms, related to a
particular VM:

1. In the vSphere client, select the VM you want to monitor.
1. At the bottom left of the client window, click **Alarms**.
1. If a VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the bottom
panel.

## <a id="vchs"></a>Monitoring in vCloud Hybrid Service (vCHS) ##

[vCenter Operations Manager](http://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-operations-manager) collects
performance data from virtual machines and disk drives in a deployment.

[vCenter Hyperic](http://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-hyperic) specifically
monitors operating systems, middleware, and applications.

Use vCenter Operations Manager and vCenter Hyperic to monitor the following
services on the vCloud Director cells (servers) in your Pivotal CF deployment:

* vmware-vcd-watchdog: Watchdog service for the cell.
* vmware-guestd: VMware Tools service. Provides heartbeat, shutdown, restart,
and custom script execution functionality.
* vmware-vcd-log-collection-agent: Log collection service for the cell.
* vmware-vcd-cell: vCloud services for the cell.
