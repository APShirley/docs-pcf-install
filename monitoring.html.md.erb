## <a id="monitor_vm"></a>Monitoring disk space usage ##

It's a good idea to monitor disk space usage, especially for certain VMs. If a VM runs out of disk space, Elastic Runtime can fail.

The vSphere server provides alarms that monitor that VMs, as well as clusters, hosts, datacenters, datastores, networks, and licensing.

To view disk usage alarms related to a particular VM:

1. In the vSphere client, select the VM you want to monitor.
1. Click Alarms at the bottom left of the client window.
1. If the VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the bottom panel.

The two essential VMs to watch are the Pivotal CF instance and the NFS server. The next sections explain what to do if these VMs start to run out of disk space.

### <a id="monitor_ops_mgr"></a>Ensuring that the Operations Manager VM has enough disk space ###

The /tmp directory in the Operations Manager VM (that is, the Installer VM) is where the VM logs go. Over time, the logs can get big enough to cause the VM to run out of disk space.

If the VM starts to run out of disk space, restart the VM to clear the log entries out of /tmp.

An alternative to watching for alarms is to set up a cron job that clears logs from /tmp on a regular basis.

### <a id="monitor_nfs"></a>Ensuring that the NFS Server VM has enough disk space ###

The NFS Server VM is the blob store where Elastic Runtime uploads applications. The default size of the blob store is 100 Gigabytes, but if enough (or large enough) applications are uploaded, the VM can run out of disk space.

If the VM starts to run out of disk space, make the VM larger by changing settings in the Resource Allocation tab of vSphere client.

## <a id="monitor_advanced"></a>More Advanced Monitoring ##

Watching for the preconfigured alarms in the vSphere client may not be a good solution for your monitoring needs. You might want to configure your own custom alarms, or monitor factors other than disk space usage, such as operating system performance.

Many tools and techniques exist for monitoring in vSphere. Try searching the VMware website for information about vCenter Operations Manager, and the vSphere Client online help for  “Monitoring Events, Alarms, and Automated Actions” or similar topics.
