### <a id="ops-manager"></a>Operations Manager VM Disk Space ###

The Ops Manager stores its logs on the Ops Manager VM in the `/tmp` directory.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The logs collect over time and do not self-delete. To prevent the VM from running out of disk space, restart the VM to clear the
log entries from <code>/tmp</code>.</p>

## <a id="vsphere"></a>Monitoring in vSphere ##

To monitor VMs using the vSphere client:

1. Connect to a vCenter Server instance using the vSphere client.
1. Navigate to the **Hosts And Clusters** or **VMs And Templates** inventory view.
1. In the inventory tree, select a virtual machine.
1. Select the **Performance** tab from the content pane on the right.

VMware vSphere Server provides alarms that monitor VMs, as well as clusters,
hosts, datacenters, datastores, networks, and licensing.
To view preconfigured alarms, including disk usage alarms, related to a
particular VM:

1. In the vSphere client, select the VM you want to monitor.
1. At the bottom left of the client window, click **Alarms**.
1. If a VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the bottom
panel.
