title: Monitoring in Pivotal CF
---

To successfully operate Pivotal CF, you must know how to do some basic monitoring, and be aware of known issues for the current release.

This section covers monitoring essentials and suggests sources for finding more powerful tools and techniques.

## <a id="monitor_vm"></a>Monitoring a VM to avoid running out of disk space ##

Be prepared to act to keep certain VMs from running out of disk space. If a VM runs out of disk space, Elastic Runtime can fail.

The vSphere client lets you detect problems with VMs in the following way:

1. Select the VM you want to monitor.
1. Click Alarms at the bottom left of the client window.
1. If the VM starts to run out of disk space, an alarm appears in the bottom panel.

The two essential VMs to watch are the Pivotal CF instance and the NFS server. The next sections explain what to do if these VMs start to run out of disk space.

### <a id="monitor_ops_mgr"></a>Ensuring that the Operations Manager VM has enough disk space ###

The /tmp directory in the Operations Manager VM (that is, the Installer VM) is where the VM logs go. Over time, the logs can get big enough to cause the VM to run out of disk space.

If the VM starts to run out of disk space, restart the VM to clear the log entries out of /tmp.

An alternative to watching for alarms is to set up a cron job that clears logs from /tmp on a regular basis.

### <a id="monitor_nfs"></a>Ensuring that the NFS Server VM has enough disk space ###

The NFS Server VM is the blob store where Elastic Runtime uploads applications. The default size of the blob store is 100 Gigabytes, but if enough (or large enough) applications are uploaded, the VM can run out of disk space.

If the VM starts to run out of disk space, make the VM larger by changing settings in the Resource Allocation tab of vSphere client.

Watching for alarms may not be a good solution for your monitoring needs. You might to monitor factors other than disk space usage, such as operating system performance, for example.

Many tools and techniques exist for monitoring in vSphere. Try searching the VMware website for information about vCenter Operations Manager, and the  vSphere Client online help for  “Monitoring Events, Alarms, and Automated Actions” or similar topics.
