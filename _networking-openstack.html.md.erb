1. Select **Networking**.

1. The values you enter in the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields depend on whether you are using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer. Find your load balancer type in the table below to determine how to complete these fields.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to assign specific IP addresses in either the <strong>Router IPs</strong> or <strong>HAProxy IPs</strong> field, ensure that these IP addresses are in your subnet.</p>

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th><strong>LOAD BALANCER</strong></th>
        <th><strong>ROUTER IP FIELD VALUE</strong></th>
        <th><strong>HAPROXY IP FIELD VALUE</strong></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Your own load balancer</td>
	<td>Enter the IP address or addresses for PCF that you registered with your load balancer. Refer to the <a href='../customizing/custom-load-balancer.html'>Using Your Own Load Balancer</a> topic for help using your own load balancer with PCF.</td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HAProxy load balancer</td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
        <td>Enter at least one HAProxy IP address. Point your DNS to this address. For more information, see <a href="../opsguide/ssl-term-haproxy.html">Configuring SSL/TLS Termination at HAProxy</a>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1. (Optional) In **SSH Proxy IPs**, add the IP address for your Diego Brain, which will accept requests to SSH into application containers on port `2222`.

1. (Optional) In **TCP Router IPs**, add the IP address(es) you would like assigned to the TCP Routers. You enable this feature at the bottom of this screen.

   1. Return to the top of the **Networking** screen. In **TCP Router IPs** field, make sure you have entered IP addresses within your subnet CIDR block. These will be the same IP addresses you configured your load balancer with in [Pre-Deployment Steps](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html), unless you configured DNS to resolve the TCP domain name directly to an IP you've chosen for the TCP router. You can enter multiple values as a comma-delimited list or as a range. For example, `10.254.0.1, 10.254.0.2` or `10.254.0.1-10.254.0.2`.

1. By default, the Elastic Runtime routers handle traffic for applications deployed to an isolation segment created by the PCF Isolation Segment tile. To configure the Elastic Runtime routers to reject requests for applications within isolation segments, select the **Routers reject requests for Isolation Segments** checkbox.
  <%= image_tag 'isolate-network.png' %>
  Do not enable this option without deploying routers for each isolation segment. See the [Installing PCF Isolation Segment](../opsguide/installing-pcf-is.html) topic for more information.
