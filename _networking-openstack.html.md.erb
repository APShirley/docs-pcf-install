1. Select **Networking**.

1. The values you enter in the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields depend on whether you are using HAProxy in your deployment. Use the table below to determine how to complete these fields.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to assign specific IP addresses in either the <strong>Router IPs</strong> or <strong>HAProxy IPs</strong> field, ensure that these IP addresses are in the subnet that you configured for Elastic Runtime in Ops Manager.</p>

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Using HAProxy?</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Router IPs Field</strong></th>
        <th><strong>HAProxy IPs Field</strong></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>No</td>
        <td><ol>
        <li>Choose IP addresses from the subnet you configured in Ops Manager.</li>
        <li>Enter these IP addresses in the <b>Router IPs</b> field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability.</li>
        <li>Configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains that you have configured for your deployment to these IP addresses.</li>
        </ol></td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>Leave this field blank.</td>
        <td><ol>
        <li>Choose IP addresses from the subnet you configured in Ops Manager.</li>
        <li>Enter these IP addresses in the <b>HAProxy IPs</b> field. You should specify more than one IP address for high availability. </li>
        <li>Configure your load balancer to forward requests for the domains you have configured for your deployment to these IP addresses.</li>
        </ol>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
1. (Optional) In **SSH Proxy IPs**, add the IP address for your Diego Brain, which will accept requests to SSH into application containers on port `2222`.

1. Under **Select one of the following point-of-entry options**, choose one of the following options:
  * **Forward SSL to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that can forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. Complete the fields for the **Router SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** and **Router SSL Ciphers**.
  * **Forward unencrypted traffic to Elastic Runtime Router**: Select this option if your deployment uses an external load balancer that cannot forward encrypted traffic to the Elastic Runtime Router, or for a development environment that does not require load balancing. 
  * **Forward SSL to HAProxy**: Select this option to use HAProxy as your first point of entry. Complete the fields for **SSL Certificate and Private Key**, and **HAProxy SSL Ciphers**. Select **Disable HTTP traffic to HAProxy** if you want the HAProxy to only allow HTTPS traffic.  
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For details about different SSL termination point options, which correspond to different points-of-entry for Elastic Runtime, see the <a href="../opsguide/security_config.html#ssl_term">Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point</a> topic.</p> 
1. If you are not using SSL encryption or if you are using self-signed certificates, select **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment**. Selecting this checkbox also disables SSL verification for route services.

1. Select the **Disable insecure cookies on the Router** checkbox to set the secure flag for cookies generated by the router.

1. In the **Choose whether or not to enable route services** section, choose either **Enable route services** or **Disable route services**.  Route services are a class of [marketplace services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace) that perform filtering or content transformation on application requests and responses. See the [Route Services](../services/route-services.html) topic for details. 

1. The **Loggregator Port** defaults to `443` if left blank. Enter a new value to override the default.
  
1. Optionally, use the **Applications Subnet** field if you need to avoid address collision with a third-party service on the same subnet as your apps. Enter a CIDR subnet mask specifying the range of available IP addresses assigned to your app containers. The IP range must be different from the network used by the system VMs.

1. Optionally, you can change the value in the **Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** field. Pivotal recommends setting the MTU value for your application network to `1454`. Some configurations, such as networks that use GRE tunnels, may require a smaller MTU value.   

1. Optionally, increase the number of seconds in the **Router Timeout to Backends** field to accommodate larger uploads over connections with high latency. 

1. (Optional) Increase the value of **Load Balancer Unhealthy Threshold** to specify the amount of time, in seconds, that the router continues to accept connections before shutting down. During this period, healthchecks may report the router as unhealthy, which causes load balancers to failover to other routers. Set this value to an amount greater than or equal to the maximum time it takes your load balancer to consider a router instance unhealthy, given contiguous failed healthchecks.

1. (Optional) Modify the value of **Load Balancer Healthy Threshold**. This field specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait until declaring the Router instance started. This allows an external load balancer time to register the Router instance as healthy.
