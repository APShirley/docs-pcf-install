Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.11 and earlier releases do not support PCF Isolation Segment. 

The PCF Isolation Segment tile allows operators to isolate deployment workloads into dedicated resource pools called _isolation segments_. 

You must install PCF v1.12 or higher to install PCF Isolation Segment tile.

For more information about the PCF Isolation Segment tile, see [Installing PCF Isolation Segment](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/installing-pcf-is.html).
