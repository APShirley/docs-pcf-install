1. CF API Rate Limiting prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval. 
	<br><br>
	To disable CF API Rate Limiting, select **Disable** under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**. To enable CF API Rate Limiting, perform the following steps:
	
	1. Under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General Limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated Limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour interval. The default value is `100`.

1. Under **Enable secure communication between Diego and Cloud Controller?**, ensure that **Enable** is selected.
	<br><br>
	In previous versions of PCF, the Cloud Controller Bridge provided a translation layer between the Cloud Controller and Diego. PCF 1.12 includes a new Cloud Controller that can communicate directly to Diego without using a translation layer. This new communication path is secured with mutual TLS.
	<br><br>
	In a fresh install, the Cloud Controller communicates directly and securely with Diego, and the Cloud Controller Bridge is disabled. In upgrades, however, operators must disable the Cloud Controller Bridge manually to ensure the Cloud Controller communicates directly and securely with Diego.
