	In previous versions of PCF, the Cloud Controller Bridge provided a translation layer between the Cloud Controller and Diego. PCF 1.11 includes a new Cloud Controller that can communicate directly to Diego without using a translation layer. This new communication path is secured with mutual TLS.

	In a fresh install, the Cloud Controller communicates directly and securely with Diego, and the Cloud Controller Bridge is disabled. In upgrades, however, operators must disable the Cloud Controller Bridge manually to ensure the Cloud Controller communicates directly and securely with Diego.
