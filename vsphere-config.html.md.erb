for VMware vSphere product tile.

## <a id='access-ops-man'></a>Step 1: Access Ops Manager

1. Log in to [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) Operations Manager.

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere** tile.

## <a id='vcenter-config'></a>Step 2: vCenter Config Page

1. Select **vCenter Config** and enter the following information:
    1. vCenter IP address
    1. vCenter credentials
    1. Datacenter name
    1. A comma-delimited list of datastore names
    1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("vcenter-credentials.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The vCenter credentials must grant
    create and delete privileges for VMs and folders.</p>

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.
    1. Enter a comma-delimited list of time server addresses.
    1. If you have installed and configured the Ops Metrics product, enter the
    Metrics IP address.
    1. Click **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable the Ops Manager
    Resurrector functionality and increase Elastic Runtime availability.
    For more information, see the introduction and Limitation sections of the
    [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](./resurrector.html) topic.
    1. Pivotal recommends that you select **Internal** for your **Blobstore
    Location**.
    However, if you choose **S3 Compatible Blobstore** for your blobstore
    location, complete the **S3 Endpoint**, **Bucket Name**, **Access Key**, and
    **Secret Key** with information from your blobstore provider.
    1. Select a **Database Location**.
    By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry deploys and manages a database for you.
    If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated
    fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider.
    1. **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager
    Director can run simultaneously.
    For vSphere, the default value is 32.
    Leave the Max Threads field blank to use this default value.
    Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in
    rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
    1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='az'></a>Step 4: Availability Zones Pages

1. <a id='create-az'></a>Select **Create Availability Zones**.
    Ops Manager Availability Zones correspond to your vCenter clusters and
    resource pools.
    <br /><br />
    Having multiple Availability Zones allows you to provide high-availability
    and load balancing to your applications.
    When an application runs more than one instance of a job, Ops Manager
    deterministically balances the instances across all of the Availability
    Zones that you assign to the application.
    <br /><br />
    Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your
    products to use:
    1. Click **Add**.
    1. Enter a unique name for the Availability Zone.
    1. Enter the name of an existing vCenter cluster to use as an Availability
    Zone.
    1. **(Optional)** Enter the name of a resource pool in the vCenter cluster
    that you specify.
    The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory
    resources defined by the pool.
    1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>

1. Select **Assign Availability Zones**.
    Use the drop-down menu to select an Availability Zone.
    The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone.

    <%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>

## <a id='networks'></a>Step 5: Networks Pages

1. <a id='create-networks'></a>Select **Create Networks**.
    Having multiple networks allows you to place vCenter on a private network
    and the rest of your deployment on a public network.
    Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources
    and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    <br /><br />
    Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    1. Click **Add**.
    1. Enter a unique name for the network.
    1. Enter the vSphere network name as it displays in vCenter.
    1. For **Subnet**, enter a valid CIDR block.
    1. For **Excluded IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **Subnet**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation.
    1. Enter DNS and Gateway IP addresses.
    1. Click **Save**.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco NSX 1000v
      Switch, refer to the <a href="nsx-switch.html">Using the Cisco NSX 1000v
      Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.
    </p>
    
    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

    

1. Select **Assign Networks**.
    You can configure the Ops Manager Director to have an IP address on two
    networks to give the Director access to both networks.
    Use the drop-down menu to select an **Infrastructure** network and a
    **Deployment** network for Ops Manager.
    <br /><br />
    When using multiple networks to isolate vCenter, install vCenter on the
    **Infrastructure** network and the rest of your deployment on the
    **Deployment** network.
    This gives the Director access to both vCenter and the rest of your
    deployment.

Select **Resource Config**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes, and click **Save**.
