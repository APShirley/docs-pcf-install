    1. **Database Location**: By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; deploys and manages a database for you.If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.
    1. **Max Threads**: This sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is 32. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>

## <a id='az'></a>Step 3: Availability Zone Pages

1. <a id='create-az'></a>Select **Create Availability Zones**.
    Ops Manager Availability Zones correspond to your vCenter clusters and
    resource pools.
    <br /><br />
    Having multiple Availability Zones allows you to provide high-availability
    and load balancing to your applications.
    When an application runs more than one instance of a job, Ops Manager
    deterministically balances the instances across all of the Availability
    Zones that you assign to the application.
    <br /><br />
    Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your
    products to use:
    1. Click **Add**.
    1. Enter a unique name for the Availability Zone.
    1. Enter the name of an existing vCenter cluster to use as an Availability
    Zone.
    1. **(Optional)** Enter the name of a resource pool in the vCenter cluster
    that you specify.
    The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory
    resources defined by the pool.
    1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>

1. Select **Assign Availability Zones**.
    Use the drop-down menu to select an Availability Zone.
    The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone.

    <%= image_tag("assign-az.png") %>

## <a id='networks'></a>Step 4: Network Pages

1. <a id='create-networks'></a>Select **Create Networks**.
    Having multiple networks allows you to place vCenter on a private network
    and the rest of your deployment on a public network.
    Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources
    and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    <br /><br />
    Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    1. Click **Add**.
    1. Enter a unique name for the network.
    1. Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `<DIRECTORY-NAME>/<NETWORK-NAME>`.
    1. For **Subnet**, enter a valid CIDR block.
    1. For **Excluded IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **Subnet**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation.
    1. Enter **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    1. Click **Save**.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco
      Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.
    </p>

    <%= image_tag("create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Assign Networks**.
    You can configure the Ops Manager Director to have an IP address on two
    networks to give the Director access to both networks.
    Use the drop-down menu to select an **Infrastructure** network and a
    **Deployment** network for Ops Manager.
    <br /><br />
    When using multiple networks to isolate vCenter, install vCenter on the
    **Infrastructure** network and the rest of your deployment on the
    **Deployment** network.
    This gives the Director access to both vCenter and the rest of your
    deployment.

    <%= image_tag("assign-network.png") %>

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 5: Security Page

1. Select **Security**.

1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Pivotal recommends that you use the **Generate passwords** option for greater security.

1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the Credentials tab.

<%= image_tag("security-config.png") %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 6: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the new recommended allocation.</p> 

<%= image_tag("vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='exper-features'></a>Step 7: (Optional) Experimental Features Page

These are features that you should be cautious about enabling if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

1. Select the **Experimental Features** tab.

1. Enter a trusted certificate and click **Save**.

These certificates enable BOSH-deployed VMs to trust a custom root certificate, but adding certificates in this way does not yet insert them into application containers or into your UAA's JVM store, which would be necessary to enable UAA-to-SASL trust.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When the Trusted Certificates functionality is developed to add certificates into containers and the UAA, this feature will be moved out of the Experimental Features section. </p>
