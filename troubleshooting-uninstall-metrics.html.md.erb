title: Troubleshooting and Uninstalling Pivotal Ops Metrics
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The Pivotal Ops Metrics tool is a JMX extension for Elastic Runtime.
Pivotal Ops Metrics collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
Use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The Pivotal Ops Metrics tool is composed of three virtual machines:

- The JMX Provider
- A VM that governs compilation
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](../loggregator/architecture.html)

To deploy Pivotal Ops Metrics, see the [Deploying Pivotal Ops Metrics](./deploy-metrics.html) topic.

If you see the following error during an upgrade:

1. [Install Ops Metrics 1.6](./deploy-metrics.html#import)

1. Scale the collector resource from Elastic Runtime to `0`.

    If you do not scale the collector resource, you get the following error:
