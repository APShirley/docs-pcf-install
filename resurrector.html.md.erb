title: Using Ops Manager Resurrector
---

The Ops Manager Resurrector increases Elastic Runtime availability by:

- Reacting to hardware failure and network disruptions by restarting virtual
machines on active, stable hosts.
- Detecting operating system failures by continuously monitoring virtual
machines and restarting them as required.
- Continuously monitoring the BOSH Agent running on each virtual machine and
restarting the VMs as required.

Ops Manager Resurrector continuously monitors the status of all virtual machines
in an Elastic Runtime deployment.
Additionally, the Resurrector monitors the BOSH Agent on each VM.
If either the VM or the BOSH Agent fail, Resurrector restarts the virtual
machine on another active host.

To avoid potential conflicts, if you enable the Ops Manager Resurrector on a
Pivotal CF deployment, you should exclude the VMs in the deployment from vSphere
High Availability.

**Note**: The Ops Manager Resurrector cannot protect the virtual machine running
Ops Manager.
Pivotal recommends you use vSphere High Availability to protect the Ops Manager
VM.

## Excluding Virtual Machines from vSphere High Availability ##

To enable vSphere High Availability on the Ops Manager VM but exclude the other
VMs in the Pivotal CF deployment, you must:

* Enable vSphere High Availability for the entire cluster containing the
Pivotal CF deployment.
* Disable vSphere High Availability on all the VMs in the Pivotal CF deployment
except the VM running Ops Manager.

### Enabling vSphere High Availability ###

To enable vSphere High Availability:

1. Launch the vSphere Management Console.

1. Right-click the cluster that contains the Pivotal CF deployment and select
**Edit Settings**.

1. Check the **Turn on vSphere High Availability** checkbox.

1. Click **OK** to enable vSphere High Availability on the cluster.

### Excluding Specific VMs from vSphere High Availability ###

To exclude all VMs in a Pivotal CF deployment except the Ops Manager VM from
vSphere High Availability:

1. Launch the vSphere Management Console.

1. Right-click the Pivotal CF cluster and select **Edit Settings**.

1. Under vSphere High Availability, select **VM Monitoring**.

1. In the VM Monitoring Status pane, select **VM Monitoring Only**.

1. In the Virtual Machine Settings pane, change the VM Monitoring setting of
each of the VMs in the Pivotal CF deployment, except for the Ops Manager VM, to
**Disabled**.

1. Click **OK** to disable vSphere High Availability on every VM in the Pivotal
CF deployment except the Ops Manager VM.

## Enabling Ops Manager Resurrector ##
