#### <a id="xfcc_haproxy"></a> Terminating TLS at Load Balancer

This option allows you to configure support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header in deployments where TLS is terminated at the first time at the infrastructure load balancer. 

Selecting this configuration requires the load balancer is configured to set the XFCCs header from the client certificate in the TLS handshake.

This mode is enabled when the <b>TLS terminated for the first time at infrastructure load balancer</b> option is selected in the **Networking** configuration screen of the PAS tile.
