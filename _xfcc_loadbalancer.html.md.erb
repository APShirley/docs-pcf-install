#### <a id="xfcc_haproxy"></a> Terminating TLS at Load Balancer

By default, Gorouter forwards arbitrary headers that are not otherwise mentioned in the docs. You can configure support for the XFCC header in deployments where TLS is terminated at the first time at the infrastructure load balancer.

Selecting this configuration assumes the load balancer is configured to set the XFCC header with the contents of the client certificate received in the TLS handshake.

This mode is enabled when the <b>TLS terminated for the first time at infrastructure load balancer</b> option is selected in the **Networking** configuration screen of the PAS tile.
