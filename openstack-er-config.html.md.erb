title: Installing Elastic Runtime after Deploying PCF to OpenStack
---

This topic describes how to install and configure Elastic Runtime after deploying [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) to Mirantis 
Express hosted OpenStack.

Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
topic and the [Configuring Ops Manager Director after Deploying PCF to OpenStack](./openstack-om-config.html) topics.

## <a id='log-in'></a>Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the Pivotal CF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the Pivotal Network link on the left to add Elastic Runtime to Ops 
Manager. For more information, refer to the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic.

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 2: Complete the Security Config Page ##

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile in the Installation Dashboard.

1. Select **Security Config**.

1. Click the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** link to launch the RSA 
certificate wizard.

1.	In the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** window, enter a wildcard 
domain that you own. Click **Generate**. The example in the image uses 
`*.example.com`

1. Elastic Runtime populates the **SSL Certificate** fields with RSA certificate and private key information.

1. Select the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** checkbox.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='cloud-controller'></a>Step 3: Complete the Cloud Controller Page ##

1. Select **Cloud Controller** and enter your system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic 
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

    Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name, but different 
    subdomain names, for your system domain and your app domain. 
    Doing so allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain 
    while preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes.
    For example, name your system domain `system.EXAMPLE.COM` and your apps  
    domain `apps.EXAMPLE.COM`.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='complete'></a>Step 4: Complete Elastic Runtime Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click
**Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("openstack/icmp-error.png") %>

1. Elastic Runtime installs. The image shows the **Changes Applied** message that displays when the installation process successfully completes.
