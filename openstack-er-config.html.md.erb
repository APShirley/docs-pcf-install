title: Installing Elastic Runtime after Deploying PCF on OpenStack
---

This topic describes how to install and configure Elastic Runtime after deploying [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on OpenStack.

Use this topic when [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on OpenStack](./openstack.html).

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all
steps in the [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](./openstack-setup.html)
topic and the [Configuring Ops Manager Director after Deploying PCF on OpenStack](./openstack-om-config.html) topics.

## <a id='log-in'></a>Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Click the Pivotal Network link on the left to add Elastic Runtime to Ops

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 2: Complete Security Configuration ##

<%= partial 'security_config' %>

## <a id='cloud-controller'></a>Step 3: Complete the Cloud Controller Page ##

1. Select **Cloud Controller** and enter your system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic 
      Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

    Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name, but different 
    subdomain names, for your system domain and your app domain. 
    Doing so allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain 
    while preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes.
    For example, name your system domain `system.EXAMPLE.COM` and your apps  
    domain `apps.EXAMPLE.COM`.

1. Click **Save**.

**Ignore errors and start the install**.
