This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on vSphere.

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, refer to the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) topics or to the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.html).

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you are performing an upgrade to PCF 1.8, see <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for critical upgrade information.</p>

### <a id='vsphere-reqs'></a>vSphere Requirements ###

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: When installing Ops Manager on a vSphere environment with multiple ESXi hosts, you must use network-attached or shared storage devices. Local storage devices do not support sharing across multiple ESXi hosts.</p>

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment with Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime on vSphere:

* vSphere 6.0, 5.5, or 5.1.
* Disk space: 2TB recommended.
* Memory: 120GB
* Two public IP addresses: One for Elastic Runtime and one for Ops Manager
* vCPU cores: 80
* Overall CPU: 28 GHz
* vSphere editions: standard and above.
* Ops Manager Director must have HTTPS access to vCenter and ESX hosts on TCP ports 443, 902, and 903.
* A configured vSphere cluster:
  * If you enable vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for the cluster, you must set the Automation level to **Partially automated** or **Fully automated**. If you set the Automation level to **Manual**, the BOSH automated installation will fail with a `power_on_vm` error when BOSH attempts to create virtual machines (VMs).
  * Turn hardware virtualization off if your vSphere hosts do not support VT-X/EPT. If you are unsure whether the VM hosts support VT-x/EPT, then you can turn this setting off. If you leave this setting on and the VM hosts do not support VT-x/EPT, then each VM requires manual intervention in vCenter to continue powering on without the Intel virtualized VT-x/EPT. Refer to the vCenter help topic at [Configuring Virtual Machines > Setting Virtual Processors and Memory > Set Advanced Processor Options](http://pubs.vmware.com/fusion-5/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.fusion.help.doc%2FGUID-38178690-1234-4843-B135-4063F9AA73E4.html) for more information.
* Ops Manager requires read/write permissions to the datacenter level of the [vSphere Inventory Hierarchy](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-4-esx-vcenter/index.jsp?topic=/com.vmware.vsphere.dcadmin.doc_41/vsp_dc_admin_guide/managing_users_groups_roles_and_permissions/c_hierarchical_inheritance_of_permissions.html) to successfully install. Pivotal recommends using the default [VMware Administrator System Role](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp#com.vmware.wssdk.pg.doc/PG_Authenticate_Authorize.8.6.html#1110514) to achieve the appropriate permission level, or a custom role that has all privileges for all objects in the datacenter, including propagating privileges to children. For a complete list of required vSphere privileges, see the [BOSH documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/required_vcenter_privileges.md).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For information on how IaaS user roles are configured, refer to the <a href="iaas-user-roles.html">Pivotal Cloud Foundry IaaS User Role Guidelines</a> topic.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are deploying PCF behind a firewall, see the <a href="config_firewall.html">Preparing Your Firewall for Deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> topic.</p>

## <a id='install-om'></a>Step 1: Install Ops Manager ##

Complete the following procedures to install Ops Manager on vSphere:

1. <a href="./deploying-vm.html" class="subnav">Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere</a>
1. <a href="./vsphere-config.html" class="subnav">Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere</a>

## <a id='install-er'></a>Step 2: Install Elastic Runtime ##

To install Elastic Runtime on vSphere, perform the procedures in the <a href="./config-er-vmware.html" class="subnav">Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere</a> topic.

## <a id='ipsec'></a>(Optional) Step 3: Install the IPsec Add-on

The PCF IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a PCF deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall. See the [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html) topic for installation instructions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must install the PCF IPsec add-on before installing any other tiles to enable the IPsec functionality. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 4: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed PCF, add users to your account.
Refer to the [Creating New Elastic Runtime User Accounts](../opsguide/creating-account.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 5: Target Your Deployment ##

Use the cf Command Line Interface (CLI) to target your deployment.
Make sure that you have [installed the cf CLI tool](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
Refer to the PCF documentation for more information about [using the cf
command line tool](../cf-cli/getting-started.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In Ops Manager, refer to
    <strong>Elastic Runtime > Credentials</strong> for the UAA admin name and
    password. You can also use the user that you created in Apps Manager, or
    create another user with the <code>create-user</code> command.</p>
