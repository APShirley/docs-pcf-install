title: Recovering MySQL from Elastic Runtime Downtime
owner: RelEng
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<p>This topic describes the manual procedure for recovering a terminated Elastic Runtime cluster, via a process known as bootstrapping.</p>

## When to Bootstrap

<p>Bootstrapping is only required when the cluster has lost quorum. Quorum is lost when less than half of the nodes can communicate with each other (for longer than the configured grace period). If quorum has <strong>not</strong> been lost, individual unhealthy nodes should automatically rejoin the cluster once repaired (error resolved, node restarted, or connectivity restored). </p>

#### Symptoms of Lost Quorum

* All nodes appear "Unhealthy" on the proxy dashboard:
  <img src="https://docs.pivotal.io/edge/p-mysql/quorum-lost.png">
* All responsive nodes report the value of `wsrep_cluster_status` as `non-Primary`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_status';
    +----------------------+-------------+
    | Variable_name        | Value       |
    +----------------------+-------------+
    | wsrep_cluster_status | non-Primary |
    +----------------------+-------------+
    </pre>

* All responsive nodes respond with `ERROR 1047` when queried with most statement types.

    <pre class="terminal">
    mysql> select * from mysql.user;
    ERROR 1047 (08S01) at line 1: WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use
    </pre>

See [MySQL Cluster Behavior](../../edge/p-mysql/cluster-behavior.html) for more details about determining cluster state.

<p>In the event that all of the MySQL virtual machines (VMs) are terminated, the cluster will not automatically restart as it has by definition lost quorum. For example, this process is necessary when all Elastic Runtime VMs are removed on AWS. Follow the below procedure to recreate the lost VMs before completing the bootstrapping process to recover the cluster.</p>

    </pre>

Next, complete the bootstrapping process in the following section.

## <a id='bootstrapping'></a>Bootstrap ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Bootstrapping requires you to run commands from the <a href="./../customizing/index.html">Ops Manager Director</a>. Follow the instructions to use the <a href="./../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare">BOSH CLI</a> for command-line access.</p>

## <a id="assisted-bootstrap"></a>Assisted Bootstrap ##

1. Elastic Runtime versions 1.7.0 and later include a [BOSH errand](http://bosh.io/docs/jobs.html#jobs-vs-errands) to automate the process of bootstrapping. It is still necessary to manually initiate the bootstrap process, but using this errand reduces the number of manual steps necessary to complete the process.

    In most cases, running the errand is sufficient, however there are some conditions which require additional steps.

    #### <a id="how-it-works"></a>How it works ####

    The bootstrap errand simply automates the steps in the manual bootstrapping process documented below. It finds the node with the highest transaction sequence number, and asks it to start up by itself (i.e. in bootstrap mode), then asks the remaining nodes to join the cluster.

    ### <a id="cluster-disrupted"></a>Scenario 1: Virtual Machines running, Cluster Disrupted ###

    1. If the nodes are up and running, but the cluster has been disrupted, the jobs will appear as `failing.` The output of `bosh instances` will look like this:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ bosh instances
        [...]
        +--------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+------------+
        | Instance                                         | State   | Resource Pool                                  | IPs        |
        +--------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+------------+
        | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905/0           | failing | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905           | 10.0.16.55 |
        | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905/1           | failing | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905           | 10.0.16.56 |
        | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905/2           | failing | mysql-partition-a813339fde9330e9b905           | 10.0.16.57 |
        +--------------------------------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+------------+
        </pre>

        In this situation, it is OK to immediately try the bootstrap errand:

        1. Log into the BOSH director
        1. Select the correct deployment
        1. `bosh run errand bootstrap`

        You will see many lines of output, eventually followed by:

        <pre class="terminal">
        Bootstrap errand completed

        [stderr]
        + echo 'Started bootstrap errand ...'
        + JOB_DIR=/var/vcap/jobs/bootstrap
        + CONFIG_PATH=/var/vcap/jobs/bootstrap/config/config.yml
        + /var/vcap/packages/bootstrap/bin/cf-mysql-bootstrap -configPath=/var/vcap/jobs/bootstrap/config/config.yml
        + echo 'Bootstrap errand completed'
        + exit 0

        Errand `bootstrap' completed successfully (exit code 0)
        </pre>

        <p>There are times when this won't work immediately. Unfortunately, sometimes it is best to wait and try again a few minutes later.</p>
    ### <a id="vms-terminated"></a>Scenario 2: Virtual Machines Terminated or Lost ###
    1. In more severe circumstances, such as power failure, it's possible that all of your VMs have been lost. They'll need to be recreated before you can begin to recover the cluster. In this case, you'll see the nodes appear as `unknown/unknown` in the BOSH output.

        <pre class="terminal">

        #### <a id="vm-recovery"></a>VM Recovery ####

        VM Recovery is best left to OpsManager by configuring the VM [Resurrector](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/resurrector.html#enabling). If enabled, the system will notice that the VMs are gone, and automatically attempt to recreate them. You will be able to see evidence of that by seeing the scan-and-fix job in the output of `bosh tasks recent --no-filter`.

        By watching `bosh instances` you'll see the VMs transition from `unresponsive agent` to `starting`. Ultimately, two will appear as `failing`, this is OK.

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ bosh instances

        Do not proceed to the next step until all three VMs are in the `starting`/`failing` state.

        #### <a id="updating-manifest"></a>Update the BOSH configuration ####

        In standard deployment, BOSH is configured to manage the cluster in a specific manner. You must change that configuration in order for the bootstrap errand to perform its work. Follow this process to make it possible for the bootstrap errand to succeed.

        1. Log into the BOSH director
        1. Target the correct deployment
        1. `bosh edit deployment`
            * Search for the jobs section: `jobs`
            * Search for the mysql-partition: `mysql-partition`
            * Search for the update section: `update`
            * Change max\_in\_flight to `3`.
            * Below the `max_in_flight` line, add a line: `canaries: 0`
        1. `bosh deploy`

        #### <a id="run-the-errand"></a>Run the bootstrap errand ####
        1. `bosh run errand bootstrap`
        1. Validate that the errand completes successfully.
            - Some instances may still appear as `failing`. It's OK to proceed to the next step.

        #### <a id="reset-deployment"></a>Restore the BOSH configuration ####
        1. `bosh edit deployment`
        1. Re-set `canaries` to 1, `max_in_flight` to 1, and `serial` to true in the same manner as above.
        1. `bosh deploy`
        1. Validate that all mysql instances are in `running` state.

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> It is critical that you run all of the steps. If you do not re-set the values in the BOSH manifest, the status of the jobs will not be reported correctly and can lead to troubles in future deploys.</p>

## <a id="manual-bootstrap"></a>Manual Bootstrap ##

1. If the bootstrap errand is not able to automatically recover the cluster, you may need to perform the steps manually. The following steps are prone to user-error and can result in lost data if followed incorrectly. Please follow the [assisted boostrap](#assisted-bootstrap) instructions above first, and only resort to the manual process if the errand fails to repair the cluster.

    1. SSH to each node in the cluster and, as root, shut down the mariadb process.

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ monit stop mariadb_ctrl
        </pre>

        Re-bootstrapping the cluster will not be successful unless all other nodes have been shut down.

    1. Choose a node to bootstrap.

        Find the node with the highest transaction sequence number (seqno). The sequence number of a stopped node can be retained by either reading the node's state file under `/var/vcap/store/mysql/grastate.dat`, or by running a mysqld command with a WSREP flag, like `mysqld --wsrep-recover`.<br><br>

        If a node shutdown gracefully, the seqno should be in the galera state file.

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ cat /var/vcap/store/mysql/grastate.dat | grep 'seqno:'
        </pre>

        If the node crashed or was killed, the seqno in the galera state file should be `-1`. In this case, the seqno may be recoverable from the database. The following command will cause the database to start up, log the recovered sequence number, and then exit.

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ /var/vcap/packages/mariadb/bin/mysqld --wsrep-recover
        </pre>

        **Note:** The galera state file will still say `seqno: -1` afterward.<br><br>

        Scan the error log for the recovered sequence number (the last number after the group id (uuid) is the recovered seqno):

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ grep "Recovered position" /var/vcap/sys/log/mysql/mysql.err.log | tail -1
        150225 18:09:42 mysqld_safe WSREP: Recovered position e93955c7-b797-11e4-9faa-9a6f0b73eb46:15
        </pre>

        If the node never connected to the cluster before crashing, it may not even have a group id (uuid in grastate.dat). In this case there's nothing to recover. Unless all nodes crashed this way, don't choose this node for bootstrapping.

        
        #### <a id="set-bootstrap-node"></a>Bootstrap the first node ####
        
        Use the node with the highest `seqno` value as the new bootstrap node. If all nodes have the same `seqno`, you can choose any node as the new bootstrap node.


        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Only perform these bootstrap commands on the node with the highest seqno. Otherwise the node with the highest seqno will be unable to join the new cluster (unless its data is abandoned). Its mariadb process will exit with an error. See the <a href="../../edge/p-mysql/cluster-behavior.html">Cluster Scaling, Node Failure, and Quorum</a> topic for more details on intentionally abandoning data.</p>

    1. On the new bootstrap node, update state file and restart the mariadb process:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ echo -n "NEEDS_BOOTSTRAP" > /var/vcap/store/mysql/state.txt
        $ monit start mariadb_ctrl
        </pre>

        You can check that the mariadb process has started successfully by running:

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ watch monit summary
        </pre>

        It can take up to 10 minutes for monit to start the mariadb process.

        #### <a id="restart-nodes"></a>Restart the remaining nodes ####
        
    1. Once the bootstrapped node is running, start the mariadb process on the remaining nodes via monit.

        <pre class="terminal">
        $ monit start mariadb_ctrl
        </pre>

    1. Verify that the new nodes have successfully joined the cluster. The following command should output the total number of nodes in the cluster:

        <pre class="terminal">
        mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';
        </pre>
