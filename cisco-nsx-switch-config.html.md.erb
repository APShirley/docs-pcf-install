title: Using Cisco NSX 1000v Switch with Ops Manager
---

Ops Manager Director supports Cisco NSX 1000v Switch, but requires a slightly different procedure for configuring your network.

From your PCF Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**, click the **Ops Manager Director** tile. 

Select **Create Networks**. 

Click **default** to open the configuration menu.

In the **vSphere Network Name** field, instead of entering your network name, enter the folder name and port group name for the switch, as you configured them in vCenter.

For the example vSphere environment pictured below, you would enter `drinks-dc/beer-apple` to use the switch configured on the `beer-apple` port group.
