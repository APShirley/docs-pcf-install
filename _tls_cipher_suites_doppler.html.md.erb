In the **TLS Cipher Suites for Doppler** field, specify the TLS cipher suites to use in Doppler communications. Use an ordered, colon-delimited list of Golang-supported TLS cipher suites in the RFC format. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, specify the cipher suites used by the older version of TLS.
