This section explains how to enable Container-to-Container Networking in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). You enable Container-to-Container Networking as an **Advanced Feature** in the Ops Manager Elastic Runtime tile. Container-to-Container Networking is currently in beta, is not supported, and not guaranteed to work as expected when running with all possible combinations of PCF services.

1. In Ops Manager, navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** > **Elastic Runtime** tile.

1. Click **Advanced Features**.

1. In the **Advanced Features** pane, select **Enable Container-to-Container Networking**.

1. (Optional) Enter a value in the **Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** box to override the default MTU setting.
