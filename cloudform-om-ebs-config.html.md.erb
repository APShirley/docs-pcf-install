[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) supports [Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) for PCF deployments on AWS. Amazon EBS Encryption allows operators to use full disk encryption for all persistent disks on BOSH-deployed VMs. You can use this feature to meet data-at-rest encryption requirements or as a security best practice.

There is no performance penalty for using encrypted EBS volumes. Pivotal advises all users of PCF on AWS to check this box.

## How to Enable EBS Encryption ###

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("cloudform/om-tile.png") %>

1. Select **AWS Config** to open the **AWS Management Console Config** page.

	<%= image_tag("cloudform/aws-config.png") %>

1. Select **Encrypt EBS Volumes**.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Encrypt EBS Volumes</strong> is a global setting. When selected, <strong>Encrypt EBS Volumes</strong> enables encryption on all VMs deployed by BOSH for all product tiles.</p>

1. (Optional) Enter a **Custom Encryption Key**. You can create an encryption key in the **IAM** section of your **AWS Management Console**. Look for the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and copy that value. The ARN should look similar to the following:

	```
	arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:
key/12345678-9012-3456-7890-123456789012
	```
	If you leave the field empty, the encryption key will default to the Amazon account key. For more information about creating your own encryption key, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) and [Viewing Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/viewing-keys.html) in the AWS documentation. For more information about automatic annual KMS key rotation, see [Rotating Customer Master Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html) in the AWS Documentation.

1. Click **Save**, and then return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. In Ops Manager, click **Apply Changes** and review any reported errors. The following error message lists jobs that cannot be encrypted due to unsupported instance types.

	If you find a job that should be encrypted in the error list, modify the instance type for that job in the **Resource Config** page of the Pivotal Application Service (PAS). Select an instance type that supports encryption. Pivotal recommends using <code>t2.large</code>.

1. After you make your changes in PAS, return to Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: After you enable or disable <strong>Encrypt EBS Volumes</strong> and click <strong>Apply Changes</strong>, Ops Manager recreates all existing persistent VM disks.</p>
