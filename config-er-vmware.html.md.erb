title: Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud
---

Refer to the following procedure for help configuring the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) Elastic Runtime product tile for VMware vSphere, vCloud, or vCloud Air.

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

    <%= image_tag("click-er.png") %>

1. Select **Assign Networks**. Elastic Runtime runs on the network you select.

    <%= image_tag("assign-networks-er.png") %>

1. **(vSphere Only)** Select **Assign Availability Zones**.
    These are the Availability Zones that you
    [create](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#create-az) when configuring Ops
    Manager Director.
    * Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**.
    Ops Manager runs any job with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
	* Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**.
	Ops Manager balances instances of jobs with more than one instance across
	the Availability Zones that you specify.

    <%= image_tag("availability-zones-vmware.png") %>

1. Select **Root Filesystem**.
    This page specifies the default root filesystem, or stack, for apps pushed
    to your PCF instance.

	<p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Support for the Lucid64 filesystem will
	be deprecated in a future Pivotal Cloud Foundry release. Developers or operators will need to take
	action to ensure that existing applications migrate to using the new cflinuxfs2 stack.

	For more information, refer to the <a href="../pcf-release-notes/p1-v1.4/runtime_rn_1_4.html">release notes</a> or the <a href= "http://https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/categories/200072648-Pivotal-CF-Knowledge-Base">Knowledge Base</a></p>

	Developers can override the default you specify using the cf CLI when they
	push their apps.

	<%= image_tag("rootfs-er.png") %>

1. Select **System Database Config**.
    By default, this page specifies that PCF uses an internal database for
    UAADB, ConsoleDB, CCDB, App Usage Events DB, Autoscaling and Notifications.

	Alternatively, you can configure an external AWS RDS database.
	If you choose to use an external database, complete the associated fields
	with information obtained from AWS.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you accept
	the default internal database unless you require the functionality of AWS
	RDS.</p>

	<%= image_tag("system-db.png") %>

1. Select **File Storage Config**.
    This page specifies whether to use an internal (NFS) or external (AWS S3)
    filestore.

	<%= image_tag("file-storage.png") %>

1. In the left column, select **IPs and Ports**.

1. The value you enter in the **Router IPs** field depends on whether you are
    using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.
	- **Your own load balancer**: Enter the IP address(es) for PCF that you
		registered with your load balancer.
		Refer to the [Using Your Own Load
		Balancer](../customizing/custom-load-balancer.html) topic for help using
		your own load balancer with PCF.
    - **HAProxy load balancer**: Leave this field blank.

1. The value you enter in the **HAProxy IPs** field depends on whether you are
	using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.
	- **Your own load balancer**: Leave this field blank.
    - **HAProxy load balancer**: Enter at least one HAProxy IP address.
	Point your DNS to this address.

    For more information, refer to the [Configuring PCF SSL
	Termination](../opsguide/ssl-term.html) topic.
	For help understanding the Elastic Runtime architecture, refer to the
	[Architecture](../concepts/architecture/) topic.

    <%= image_tag("ips-blank-cert.png") %>

1. The **Loggregator Port** field specifies an alternate port for Loggregator. If you leave this field blank, Elastic Runtime uses the default port 443. Pivotal recommends that you accept the default value unless you require Loggregator to use a different port.

1. <a id='generate-rsa-cert'></a>If you are using a signed **SSL Certificate**
	from a known certificate authority (CA), copy and paste its values for
	**Certificate PEM** and **Private Key PEM** into the appropriate text
	fields.
	If you have an **Intermediate CA** paste it in the same box below the
	Certificate PEM.
	Alternatively, complete the following two steps to generate self-signed RSA
	certificates.
    * Check the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** checkbox, then click
		**Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate**.
    <%= image_tag("gen-ssl.png") %>
    * Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format.
	Optionally, also add any custom domains in wildcard format.
	Click **Generate**.

    <%= image_tag("enter-ssl-domains.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Wildcard DNS records only work for a
	single domain name component or component fragment. For example,
	<code>*.domain.com</code> works for <code>apps.domain.com</code> and
	<code>system.domain.com</code>, but not <code>my.apps.domain.com</code> or
	<code>my.system.domain.com</code>.</p>

1. The **Certificate Key PEM** and **Private Key PEM** fields now contain
	certificate keys.
	Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("router-ip.png") %>

1. Select **MySQL Proxy Config**.
	Use this page to configure the MySQL proxy connections required to run the
	internal MySQL database cluster for high-availability Elastic Runtime.

	<%= image_tag("mysql-proxy.png") %>

1. <a id="cloud-controller"></a>Select **Cloud Controller** and enter the system
	and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
		Runtime.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps.

	Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name, but different
	subdomain names, for your system domain and your app domain.
	This allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain while
	preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes.

	For example, name your system domain `system.MYDOMAIN.COM` and your apps
	domain `apps.MYDOMAIN.COM`.

    <%= image_tag("cloud-controller.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Notes</strong>: You configured wildcard DNS records
	for these domains in an earlier step. </p>

1. Leave the **Cloud Controller DB encryption key** field blank unless:
    * You deployed Elastic Runtime earlier
    * You then stopped Elastic Runtime, or it crashed
    * You are re-deploying Elastic Runtime with a backup of your Cloud
	Controller database

    Enter your Cloud Controller database encryption key only if these conditions
	apply.
	See [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/backup-settings.html)
	for more information.

1. Enter your intended maximum file upload size.

1. **(Optional)** Check the **Disable Custom Buildpacks** checkbox.
    By default, the cf command line tool gives developers the option of using a
    custom buildpack when they deploy apps to Elastic Runtime.
    To do so, they use the `-b` option to provide a custom buildpack URL with
    the `cf push` command.
    The **Disable Custom Buildpacks** checkbox disables the `-b` option.
    For more information about custom buildpacks, refer to the
    [buildpacks](../buildpacks/) section of the PCF documentation.

1. Enter your default app memory and service instances quotas.

1. Click **Save**.

1. **(Optional - Advanced)** If you are forwarding syslog messages via TCP to a
    RELP syslog server, complete this step.
    Select **External Endpoints**, enter the IP address and port of the syslog
    aggregator host, and click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("external-endpoints.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the
	Elastic Runtime network, accept TCP connections, and use the RELP protocol.
	Ensure <code>syslogd</code> listens on external interfaces.</p>

1. **(Optional - Advanced)** If you are using the VMware SSO appliance for
    integration with Active Directory, complete this step.
    Follow the instructions for [Configuring Single Sign-On](../opsguide/sso.html) to configure this page.

    <%= image_tag("sso-config.png") %>

1. **(Optional - Advanced)** If you are using the LDAP endpoint for UAA, you
    must configure Elastic Runtime with your LDAP endpoint information.
    See [Configuring LDAP](../opsguide/ldap-uaa.html) for
    more information.

1. <a id='smtp'></a>**(Optional)** Select **SMTP Config**, enter your reply-
	to and SMTP email information, set **SMTP Authentication Mechanism** to `none`, and click **Save**.
    Apps Manager uses these settings to send invitations and confirmations to console users.
    These SMTP settings are required if you want to enable end-user
    self-registration.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not configure the SMTP
	settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using the cf CLI tool. See <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a> for more information.</p>

    <%= image_tag("smtp.png") %>

1. Configure **Errands**.

<%= partial 'errands' %>

1. Select **Resource Config**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes,
    and click **Save**.

1. Select **Stemcell**.
    This page displays the stemcell version that shipped with Ops Manager.
    You can also use this page to import a new stemcell version.

	<%= image_tag("stemcell.png") %>

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
    Dashboard.
