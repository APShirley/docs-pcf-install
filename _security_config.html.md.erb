1. Select **Security Config**.

1. Provide a certificate for your SSL Termination Point.
  <% if $this_IaaS == 'AWS-cloudform' %>
    This certificate must match the one that you uploaded to AWS earlier in the
    [Upload an SSL Certificate](./cloudform-template.html#upload-cert) section
    of the [Deploying the CloudFormation Template for PCF on
    AWS](./cloudform-template.html) topic.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal does not recommend using a
    self-signed certificate for production deployments.</p>
  <% else %>
  * In a production environment, use a signed **SSL Certificate**
    from a known certificate authority (CA). Copy and paste the values for
    **Certificate PEM** and **Private Key PEM** from the signed certificate
    into the appropriate text fields.
  * In a development or testing environment, you may use a self-signed
    certificate.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal does not recommend using a
    self-signed certificate for production deployments.</p>
    To use a self-signed certificate, follow the steps below:
        * Click the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** link to launch the
          RSA certificate wizard.
        * Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format.
          Optionally, also add any custom domains in wildcard format.
          The example below uses `*.example.com`.
          <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Wildcard DNS records only work
            for a single domain name component or component fragment. For
            example, <code>*.domain.com</code> works for
            <code>apps.domain.com</code> and <code>system.domain.com</code>, but
            not for <code>my.apps.domain.com</code> or
            <code>my.system.domain.com</code>.
          </p>
        * Click **Generate**.
	      <%= image_tag("openstack/generate-cert.png") %>
        * Elastic Runtime populates the **SSL Certificate** fields with RSA
          certificate and private key information.
        * Select the **Trust Self-Signed Certificates** checkbox.

1. **(Optional)** Enter a colon-separated list of custom SSL ciphers to pass to HAProxy in the **HAProxy SSL Ciphers** field. If you leave this field empty, PCF uses the default SSL ciphers specified in `cf-release/jobs/haproxy/spec`.

1. Click **Save**.
