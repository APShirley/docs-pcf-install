1. Provide an **SSL Termination Certificate** for your SSL Termination Point.
<% if $this_IaaS == 'AWS-cloudform' %>
    This certificate must match the one that you uploaded to AWS earlier in the
    [Upload an SSL Certificate](./cloudform-template.html#upload-cert) section
    of the [Deploying the CloudFormation Template for PCF on
    AWS](./cloudform-template.html) topic.

  * In a production environment, use a signed **SSL Certificate**
    from a known certificate authority (CA). Copy and paste the values for
    **Certificate PEM** and **Private Key PEM** from the signed certificate
    into the appropriate text fields.
  * In a development or testing environment, you may use a self-signed certificate with the following steps:
<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal does not recommend using a self-signed certificate for production deployments.</p>
<%= partial 'known-issue-self-signed-certs' %>
        * Click the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** link to launch the RSA certificate wizard.
        * Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format. Optionally, also add custom domains in wildcard format. The example below uses `*.YOUR-DOMAIN.com`.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SSL certificates generated for wildcard DNS records only work for a single domain name component or component fragment. For example, a certificate generated with <code>\*.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code> does not work for <code>apps.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code> and <code>system.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code>. The certificate must have both <code>apps.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code> and <code>system.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code> attributed to it. </p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can generate a single certificate for two domains separated by a comma. For example, <code>*.apps.YOUR-DOMAIN.com, *.system.YOUR-DOMAIN.com</code>.</p>
  * Click **Generate**.

  * Elastic Runtime populates the **SSL Certificate** fields with RSA certificate and private key information.
