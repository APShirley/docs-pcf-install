<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

JMX Bridge is a Java Management Extensions (JMX) tool for Elastic
Runtime.
To help you monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting, JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX
endpoint.

## <a id="cc"></a>Cloud Controller Metrics ##

JMX Bridge reports the number of Cloud Controller API requests
completed and the requests sent but not completed.

The number of requests sent but not completed represents the pending activity in
your system, and can be higher under load.
This number will vary over time, and the range it can vary over depends on
specifics of your environment such as hardware, OS, processor speeds, load, etc.
In any given environment, though, you can establish a typical range of values
and maximum for this number.

Use the Cloud Controller metrics to ensure that the Cloud Controller is processing API requests in a timely manner.
If the pending activity in your system increases significantly past the typical
maximum and stays at an elevated level, Cloud Controller requests may be failing
and additional troubleshooting may be necessary.

The following table shows the name of the Cloud Controller metric, what the
metric represents, and the metric type (data type).

<table border="1" class="nice" >
<tr>
  <th><strong>METRIC NAME</strong></th>
  <th><strong>DEFINITION</strong></th>
  <th><strong>METRIC TYPE (DATA TYPE)</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>cc.requests.completed</td><td>Number of Cloud Controller API requests completed since this instance of Cloud Controller started</td><td>Counter (Integer)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>cc.requests.outstanding</td><td>Number of Cloud Controller API requests made but not completed since this instance of Cloud Controller started</td><td>Counter (Integer)</td>
</tr>
</table>

See the [Cloud Controller](../concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html) topic for more
information about the Cloud Controller.

## <a id="router"></a>Router Metrics ##

JMX Bridge reports the number of sent requests and the number of
completed requests for each Cloud Foundry component.

The difference between these two metrics is the number of requests made to a
component but not completed, and represents the pending activity for that
component.
The number for each component can vary over time, and is typically higher under
load.
In any given environment, though, you can establish a typical range of values
and maximum for this number for each component.

Use these metrics to ensure that the Router is passing requests to other
components in a timely manner.
If the pending activity for a particular component increase significantly past
the typical maximum and stays at an elevated level, additional troubleshooting
of that component may be necessary.
If the pending activity for most or all components increases significantly and
stays at elevated values, troubleshooting of the router may be necessary.

The following table shows the name of the Router metric, what the metric
represents, and the metric type (data type).

<table border="1" class="nice" >
<tr>
  <th><strong>METRIC NAME</strong></th>
  <th><strong>DEFINITION</strong></th>
  <th><strong>METRIC TYPE (DATA TYPE)</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>router.requests<br />[component=c]</td><td>Number of requests the router has received for component <strong>c</strong> since this instance of the router has started<br /><strong>c</strong> can be CloudController or route-emitter</td><td>Counter (Integer)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>router.responses<br />[status=s,component=c]</td><td>Number of requests completed by component <strong>c</strong> since this instance of the router has started<br /><strong>c</strong> can be CloudController or route-emitter<br/><strong>s</strong> is http status family: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, and other</td><td>Counter (Integer)</td>
</tr>
</table>

See the [Router](../concepts/architecture/router.html) topic for more information about the
Router.

## <a id="cc"></a>Virtual Machine Metrics ##

JMX Bridge reports data for each virtual machine (VM) in a deployment.
Use these metrics to monitor the health of your Virtual Machines.

The following table shows the name of the Virtual Machine metric, what the
metric represents, and the metric type (data type).

<table border="1" class="nice" >
<tr>
  <th><strong>METRIC NAME</strong></th>
  <th><strong>DEFINITION</strong></th>
  <th><strong>METRIC TYPE (DATA TYPE)</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.mem.percent</td><td>Percentage of memory used on the VM</td><td>Gauge (Float, 0-100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.swap.percent</td><td>Percentage of swap used on the VM</td><td>Gauge (Float, 0-100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.disk.ephemeral.percent</td><td>Percentage of ephemeral disk used on the VM</td><td>Gauge (Float, 0-100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.disk.system.percent</td><td>Percentage of system disk used on the VM</td><td>Gauge (Float, 0-100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.cpu.sys</td><td>Amount of CPU spent in system processes</td><td>Gauge (Float)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.cpu.user</td><td>Amount of CPU spent in user processes</td><td>Gauge (Float)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>system.cpu.wait</td><td>Amount of CPU spent in waiting processes</td><td>Gauge (Float)</td>
</tr>
