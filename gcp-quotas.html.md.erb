Default quotas on a new GCP subscription will not have enough quota for a typical production-level PCF deployment. 

To view production-level deployment options for PCF on GCP, see the [Reference Architecture for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on GCP](../refarch/gcp/gcp_ref_arch.html).

The following table lists recommended resource quotas for a PCF deployment running about 100 app instances:

| Resource        | Suggested Minimum Quota                 |
| ----------------------------- |:-------------------------:|
| CPUs *Region Specific*					|150|
| Firewall Rules				   				|15|
| Forwarding Rules				   			|5|
| Global Forwarding Rules					|5|
| Global Backend Services					|5|
| Health Checks				   				|10|
| Images				   						|10|
| Static IP Addresses *Region Specific* & Assuming SNAT topology|5|
| IP Addresses Global				   		|5|
| IP Addresses *Region Specific*	& Assuming SNAT topology|5|
| Networks 									|5|
| Subnetworks									|5|
| Routes										|20|
| Target Pools								|10|
| Target HTTP Proxies Global				|5|
| Target HTTPS Proxies Global				|5|
| Total persistent disk reserved (GB) *Region Specific* | 15,000 |
