This topic describes how to install and configure Elastic Runtime on Azure.

Before you perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the procedures in the [Preparing to Deploy PCF on Azure](azure-prepare-env.html), the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure](azure-om-deploy.html), and the [Configuring Ops Manager Director on Azure](azure-om-config.html) topics. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to <a href = "http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html">install the PCF IPsec add-on</a>, you must do so before installing any other tiles. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

1. Enter the system and application domains.
    * The **System Domain** defines your target when you push apps to Elastic
      Runtime. For example, `system.azure.example.com`.
    * The **Apps Domain** defines where Elastic Runtime should serve your apps. For example, `apps.azure.example.com`.

    <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Pivotal recommends that you use the same domain name but different subdomain names for your system and app domains. Doing so allows you to use a single wildcard certificate for the domain while preventing apps from creating routes that overlap with system routes. For example, name your system domain <code>system.EXAMPLE.com</code> and your apps domain <code>apps.EXAMPLE.com</code>.</p>

1. Navigate to your DNS provider to set up a wildcard DNS record for your system domain and your apps domain. For example, 



1. Click **Save**.
