In Ops Manager v2.1 and later, you can expand your network with additional subnets. This capability was added in Pivotal Cloud Foundry v2.1 and documentation for this feature in earlier versions does not exist.

For information about this feature in current versions of the documentation, see [Expanding Your Network with Additional Subnets](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/add-subnets.html).
