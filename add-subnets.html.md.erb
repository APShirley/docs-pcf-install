<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to expand your network with additional subnets using the BOSH Director. After successfully deploying Ops Manager v2.1 and later, you can configure more than one subnet in the same availability zone (AZ).

![The Add Subnet button is floating to the right of the Subnets label in the Create Network pane of Ops Manager](images/gcp/add-subnet.png)

To add an additional subnet to your network, perform the following steps:

  1. Navigate to the **Create Networks** pane of your Ops Manager tile.
  1. Click your network's name to expand network details.
  1. Click **Add Subnet**. This action will populate a new set of subnet fields. You may need to scroll down to see the fields.
  1. Fill each of the Subnet fields. For more information on how to configure your Subnet, visit the Ops Manager configuration topic for your IaaS installation. For example, see [Create Networks Page](gcp-om-config-terraform.html#network) in the *Configuring BOSH Director on GCP (Terraform)* topic.
  1. Click **Save**.
  1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.
