This topic describes how to apply pending changes only to Ops Manager Director when you stage multiple products in a new installation or as part of an upgrade.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

By default, Ops Manager deploys Ops Manager Director and all your staged products after you click **Apply Changes** on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 

You can apply pending changes only to Ops Manager Director through the Ops Manager API, which requires adding the `deploy_products` parameter to the `POST /api/v0/installations` request.

The allowed values for the `deploy_products` parameter are the following:

* `"all"`: Apply changes to all staged products, including Ops Manager Director.
* `"none"`: Apply changes only to Ops Manager Director.

If you do not include `"deploy_products": "none"` in the `POST /api/v0/installations` request, Ops Manager deploys Ops Manager Director and all  staged products.
