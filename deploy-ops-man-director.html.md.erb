This topic describes how to apply pending changes only to Ops Manager Director when you stage multiple products in a new installation or as part of an upgrade.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

By default, Ops Manager deploys all your products that have pending changes after you click **Apply Changes** on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. You can apply changes only to the Ops Manager Director product through the Ops Manager API. To do this, you need to add the `deploy_products` parameter to the `POST /api/v0/installations` request.

The allowed values for the `deploy_products` parameter are the following:

* `"all"`: Apply changes to all staged products, including Ops Manager Director.
* `"none"`: Apply changes only to Ops Manager Director.

If you do not include the `deploy_products` parameter in the `POST /api/v0/installations` request, Ops Manager deploys Ops Manager Director and all other products with pending changes. You must set the parameter to `"none"`.

To apply pending changes to Ops Manager Director, perform the steps below:

1. Retrieve your authorization token to access the Ops Manager API. Refer to [Using the Ops Manager API](./ops-man-api.html) for the authentication instructions.

1. Submit the `POST /api/v0/installations` request with the `deploy_products` parameter set to `"none"`. See the following example:

	  }'
	</pre>
