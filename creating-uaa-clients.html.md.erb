title: Creating UAA (User Account and Authentication) Clients for Running Bash Scripts
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to create a UAA client on the Ops Manager Director, in order to run Bash scripts against BOSH. 

If you chose to use Internal Authentication when configuring Ops Manager, you do not need to perform these steps, because your scripts can obtain a one-time authorization code from the Ops Manager Director UAA. If you chose to use an external Identity Provider, however, you need to create a client on the Ops Manager Director UAA to give your script the proper access permissions.

1. Obtain your Ops Manager IP address.

1. SSH into your IP address.


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You should only perform these steps if you chose to use an external Identity Provider instead of Internal Authentication when configuring Ops Manager.</p>
