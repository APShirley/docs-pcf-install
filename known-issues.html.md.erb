title: Known Issues

 Version 1.0.0.1 of Pivotal CF includes the following known issues:

 * vSphere folder names with special characters in the name will cause failures.
 * You must use the UAAC gem to create additional admin users.
 * Changing the CF admin user's password will revert if Elastic Runtime is re-installed.
 * If vSphere performance data is not available, a deploy will result in a divide by zero error.
 * Networks, clusters, and datacenters cannot be in folders.
 * If DHCP is available to the Pivotal CF VM, the IP could be reset from the static IP (reboot to fix).
 * Admins must create organizations and users if SMTP is not available for inviting users via email.
 * SMTP settings for the console must be changed manually after the first deploy.
 * Deleting a service (MySQL, Rabbit, HD) from the Product Dashboard requires manual service broker removal.
 * Logging into the Pivotal CF VM causes browser to complain about self-signed certificates.
 * You must turn hardware virtualization off if the vSphere host does not support VT-X/EPT.
 * If you delete and add products in the same update, the Pivotal CF Operations Manager will attempt to use IPs for the new products that have not yet been freed and will raise an error. Instead, delete products and click **Install Updates** before attempting to add products.
 * Forcing the login server to use SSL is not supported for deployments that use the 172.16/12 network range. Instead, set login.protocol to http in your deployment manifest.

 * Active Directory and LDAP integration for Pivotal CF users with the VMware vCenter Single Sign-On Appliance requires a manual procedure.
