<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) 
(PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## <a id="prerequisities"></a> Prerequisites ##

The following sections describe general requirements for running PCF and 
specific requirements for running PCF on AWS.

### <a id='general'></a> General Requirements 

<%= partial "requirements" %>

### <a id="aws"></a>AWS Requirements ##

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a highly 
available [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) 
(PCF) deployment with Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime on Amazon Web Services 
infrastructure:

* 3 Elastic Load Balancer
* 1 Relational Database Service. We recommend at least a db.m3.xlarge instance with 100 GB of allocated storage.
* 5 S3 Buckets
* EC2 Instances:
  * 24 t2.micro
  * 4 t2.small
  * 4 t2.medium
  * 5 m4.large
  * 3 m3.xlarge
  * 3 m4.xlarge
  * 3 m3.2xlarge
  * 4 c4.xlarge

  	By default, Elastic Runtime deploys the number of VM instances required to 
	run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or 
	sandbox PCF that does not require high availability (HA), you can scale down the 
	number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of 
	instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see 
	[Scaling Elastic Runtime](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).

You must have the following to install PCF on AWS:

* An AWS account that can accommodate the minimum resource requirements for a PCF installation.
* The appropriate region selected within your AWS account. 
For help selecting the correct region for your deployment, see the [AWS documentation about regions and availability zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones).
* The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine and configured with user credentials that have admin access to your AWS account.
* Sufficiently high instance limits, or no instance limits, on your AWS account. Installing PCF requires more than the default 20 concurrent instances.
* A key pair to use with your PCF deployment. For more information, see the [AWS documentation about creating a key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* A registered wildcard domain for your PCF installation. You need this registered domain when configuring your SSL certificate and Cloud Controller. 
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about Creating a Server Certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html#create-cert).
* An SSL certificate for your PCF domain. This can be a self-signed certificate, but Pivotal recommends using a self-signed certificate for testing and development. 
You should obtain a certificate from your Certificate Authority for use in production. 
For more information, see the [AWS documentation about SSL certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html).

## <a id='install-pcf'></a> Install PCF on AWS ##

You can install PCF on AWS in one of the following ways:

* [Install PCF on AWS Manually](aws-manual-install.html): This procedure provides instructions for manually creating the necessary infrastructure resources to deploy PCF. 
* [Install PCF on AWS using CloudFormation](cloudform-install.html): This procedure provides instructions for using the CloudFormation template to create the necessary infrastructure resources to deploy PCF.

## <a id='delete-pcf'></a> Delete PCF on AWS ##

You can use the AWS console to remove an installation of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment:
