Pivotal recommends using highly resilient and redundant _external_ filestores for your Elastic Runtime file storage. This approach minimizes system downtime. 

When configuring file storage for the Cloud Controller in Elastic Runtime, you can select:

* Internal WebDAV filestore
* External S3 or Ceph-compatible filestore
* External Google Cloud Storage
