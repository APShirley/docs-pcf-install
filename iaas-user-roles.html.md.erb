This topic describes practices recommended by Pivotal for creating secure IaaS user roles.

Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) is an automated platform that connects to IaaS providers such as AWS and OpenStack. This connectivity typically requires accounts with appropriate permissions to act on behalf of the operator to access IaaS functionality such as creating Virtual Machines (VMs), managing networks and storage, and other related services. 

Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime can be configured with IaaS users in different ways depending on your IaaS. Other product tiles and services might also use their own IaaS credentials. Refer to the documentation for those product tiles or services to configure them securely.

##<a id="lpus"></a> Least Privileged Users (LPUs)

Pivotal recommends scoping privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role. In the event that someone gets access to credentials by mistake or through malicious intent, LPUs limit the scope of the breach. Pivotal recommends following best practices for the particular IaaS you are deploying.

For more information about the principle of least privilege, see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). 


##<a id="aws"></a> Configuring IaaS User Roles on AWS
Pivotal strongly recommends the use of CloudFormation scripts for AWS deployments to create users with least privilege. The chain of custody starts with a master account credential that can create IAM users. Pivotal strongly discourages the use of a master account user or IAM user. It is strongly recommended to have an IAM role and instance profile that can create just enough of the EC2, VPC, and EBS credentials that are necessary.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose not to use the CloudFormation scripts, Pivotal encourages you to use the permissions determined by <code>PcfIamPolicy</code> section of the Ops Manager CloudFormation template to create users with appropriate permissions. Additionally, follow AWS account security best practices such as disabling root keys, MFA on root, and CloudTrail for auditing API actions.</p>

See the table below for more information on the two CloudFormation templates.
