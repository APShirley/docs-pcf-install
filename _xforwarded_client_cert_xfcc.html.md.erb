 Under **Configure the CF Router support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header**, configure how the Gorouter handles `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP headers. 
    <%= image_tag 'networking_xforwarded-client-cert-xfcc.png' %>
     The following table describes which option to choose based on your deployment layout.
