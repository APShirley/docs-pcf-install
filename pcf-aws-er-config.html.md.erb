title: Configuring Elastic Runtime for AWS
---

This topic describes how to configure the Pivotal Elastic Runtime components that you need to run <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> (PCF) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Before following this procedure, complete all steps in the [Configuring AWS for PCF](./pcf-aws-component-config.html) and [Configuring Ops Manager Director for AWS](./pcf-aws-om-config.html) topics.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PCF for AWS functionality works only in the us-east-1 region. You cannot deploy PCF to any other region. </p>

## <a id='pcfaws-er-om-add'></a>Step 1: Add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager ##

1. Navigate to the Pivotal CF Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the Pivotal Network link on the left to add Elastic Runtime to Ops Manager. 

    For more information, refer to the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html) topic.

1. Click the Elastic Runtime tile in the Installation Dashboard.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-az-networks'></a>Step 2: Assign Networks and Availability Zones ##

1. Click **Assign Network**.
1. Select the network you created in the [Networks Pages](./pcf-aws-om-config.html#pcfaws-om-networks) section of the _Configuring Ops Manager Director for AWS_ topic, and click **Save**.
1. Click **Assign Availability Zones**.
1. Select the option button and checkbox to define the availability zone for singleton jobs and job balancing.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-sslcert'></a>Step 3: Configure System Databases ##
If you would like to would like to use the external RDS instance for your Elastic Runtime tile's databases, you should follow these instructions

You will first need to create the databases that Elastic Runtime requires. These instructions will create those databases on the same RDS instance you created in (link to RDS creation step in AWS setup)

1. Add your Ops Manager VM key pair to your ssh profile, so that you can access the machine.
e.g. `ssh-add ops_mgr.pem`
1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM (you can find its IP from the AWS EC2 console) with the username, ubuntu.
e.g. `ssh ubuntu@1.1.1.1`
1. Copy this script (insert link to script - create_pcf_ert_databases.sql) to your box:
e.g. `scp user@local-machine:~/workspace/create_pcf_ert_databases.sql ubuntu@1.1.1.1:~`
1. Then run the script via mysql client. It will prompt you to enter the password for your RDS user.
`mysql -h <your-RDS-host> -u <your-RDS-username> -p < ~/create_pcf_ert_databases.sql`
1. You're now done with creating the databases on the RDS instance, so you can close your connection to the Ops Manager VM at this point.
1. Navigate to the Elastic Runtime tile's System Database Config section.
1. Select External Databases
1. Enter the RDS hostname, port (`3306`), username, and password.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-sslcert'></a>Step 4: Configure File Storage ##
If you would like to would like to use Amazon S3 for your Elastic Runtime tile's file storage, you should follow these instructions

1. Navigate to S3 on your AWS console, and create a bucket with a name of your choosing.
1. Navigate to the Elastic Runtime tile's File Storage Config section.
1. Select Amazon S3.
1. Enter the bucket name you chose.
1. Enter your Access Key and Secret Key. To retrieve your AWS key information, use the IAM credentials that you generated. Refer to the Obtain AWS Credentials section of the Configuring AWS for PCF topic.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-sslcert'></a>Step 5: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate ##

1. Select **IPs and Ports**.
1. Leave the **Router IPs** and **HAProxy IPs** fields blank.
1. Ensure that the **Loggregator Port** field is set to **4443**.
1. Click the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** link to launch the RSA certificate wizard. 
1. On the **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate** window, select a wildcard domain that you own and click **Generate**. The example in the image uses *.example.com.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_ssrsacert.png") %>

1. Elastic Runtime populates the **SSL Certificate** fields with RSA certificate and private key information.
1. Click **Trust Self-Signed Certificates**.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-lb'></a>Step 6: Finalize the Load Balancer Setup ##

In this step, you complete your load balancer configuration that you began when setting up AWS components for PCF. For more information, see the [Prepare a Load Balancer and Wildcard DNS Record](./pcf-aws-component-config.html#pcfaws-lb-cname) section in the _Configure AWS for PCF_ topic.

1. On the EC2 Dashboard, click **Load Balancers**.
1. Select the load balancer you created in the [Prepare a Load Balancer and Wildcard DNS Record](./pcf-aws-component-config.html#pcfaws-lb-cname) section of the _Configuring AWS for PCF_ topic. The **Load balancer** detail tabs display at the bottom of the page.
1. Select **Listeners**.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_lb_add_listeners.png") %>
	
1. Click **Edit** to define a second listener with the following values for use with websockets:
    * **Load Balancer Protocol**: **SSL (Secure TCP)**
    * **Load Balancer Port**: `4443`
    * **Instance Protocol**: **TCP**
    * **Instance Port**: `80`
	
1. Click **Edit** to define a third listener with the following values:
    * **Load Balancer Protocol**: **SSL (Secure TCP)**
    * **Load Balancer Port**: `443`
    * **Instance Protocol**: **TCP**
    * **Instance Port**: `80`

    When you click **Save**, AWS prompts you to enter SSL certificates for these listeners.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_lb_add_sslcert.png") %>

1. Click **Change** in the **SSL Certificate** column of the second listener.
1. On the Select Certificate page, click **Upload a new SSL Certificate** and complete the following information:
    * Enter a **Certificate Name**.
    * **Private Key** and **Public Key Certificate**: Paste the RSA certificate and private key information from the **SSL Certificate** fields of the IP and Ports page to the appropriate field.
    * Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_lb_cert_details.png") %>
	
1. Click **Change** in the **SSL Certificate** column of the third listener.
1. Select **Choose an existing SSL certificate** and select the certificate that you previously uploaded for the second listener.

    The image shows the completed listener information.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_lb_cert_done.png") %>

1. Click **Save** to complete the load balancer configuration.


## <a id='pcfaws-er-clocon'></a>Step 7: Configure the Cloud Controller ###

1. Click **Cloud Controller**. 
1. Enter your domain name without the asterisk in the **System Domain** and **Apps Domain** fields: for example, `pivotalcf.com`. The image shows the correct format.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_clocon.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-resource'></a>Step 8: Configure Resources ##

Because you are using RDS, S3, and ELBs, you can turn off a variety of VMs that you won't be using.

1. Click **Resource Config** and edit the following fields: 
    * **NFS Server**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **Cloud Controller Database**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **UAA Database**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **Console Database**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **HAProxy**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **MySQL Proxy**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.
    * **MySQL Server**: Enter `0` in **Instances**.

1. On the same page:
    * **Router**: Enter the load balancer name in **ELB Name** that you created in the [Prepare a Load Balancer and Wildcard DNS Record](./pcf-aws-component-config.html#pcfaws-lb-cname) section of the _Configuring AWS for PCF_ topic.

    The images show the edited fields.

    <%= image_tag("pcfaws/er_resource_config.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='pcfaws-er-complete'></a>Step 7: Complete the Elastic Runtime Installation ##

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click **Apply Changes** to begin your installation of Elastic Runtime.

    The install process generally requires a minimum of 90 minutes to complete. The image shows the **Changes Applied** window that displays when the installation process successfully completes.
