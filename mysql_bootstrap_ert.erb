Things you'll need to start:

1. the key file from Ops Manager Director > Settings > SSH Private Key
1. the password for Director in Ops Manager Director > Credentials > Director
1. the IP address for the "Ops Manager Director" which is under the Status tab

Steps:

1. Copy and paste the private key to a file: `cat > director.key; chmod 600 director.key`
1. `ssh-add director.key`**
1. ssh -A pcf.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -l ubuntu
1. `bosh target BoshDirectorIP`, enter director and the password from above
1. `bosh deployments`
1. `bosh vms cf-8c00fbbee829841ddad3 --details | grep mysql-partition`
1. bosh download manifest cf-64f27267ea9cbfe823e1 /tmp/cf.yml
> Acting as user 'director' on deployment 'cf-64f27267ea9cbfe823e1' on 'p-bosh-1619138d4e65bbf2138e'
1. bosh deployment /tmp/cf.yml


Mess it up:

`bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2 --hard`

Bring the VMs back up:

`bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2`

Log into the first mysql VM:


1. `bosh ssh mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0`
1. Become super user using the password you've just specified: `sudo su -`
1. Check on the status of the jobs: `monit status`
  - `mariadb_ctrl`, `galera-healthcheck`, etc should all be `running`/`monitored`.

### Common Issues

** If you experience an error that looks something like:

> Received disconnect from 10.0.1.19: 2: Too many authentication failures for bosh_64898ue98

You likely have too many key identities loaded in your authentication agent. You can clear all of them using `ssh-add -D`.


- If you have an issue with not being able to `monit start` it may be due to a bug in mariadb_ctrl that doesn't collect a defunct process. In that case, you'll need to call support in order to get monit un-stuck. Please also see the Known Issues file.

- FIXME: document the use of `bosh instances --ps`

First, you need to SSH into Ops Mgr.

Bosh deployments, target the cf deployment from the /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments folder

bosh vms | grep mysql-partition
