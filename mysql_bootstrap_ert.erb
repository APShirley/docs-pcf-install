Things you'll need to start
1. the key file from Ops Manager Director > Settings > SSH Private Key
1. the password for Director in Ops Manager Director > Credentials > Director


Steps:
1. `ssh-add foo.key`
1. ssh -A pcf.SYSTEM-DOMAN
1. `bosh target BoshDirectorIP`, enter director and the password from above
1. `bosh deployments`
1. `bosh vms cf-8c00fbbee829841ddad3 --details | grep mysql-partition`

Mess it up:
`bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2 --hard`

Bring the VMs back up:
`bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2`

Log into the first mysql VM:
1. `bosh ssh mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0`
1. Become super user using the password you've just specified: `sudo su -`
1. Check on the status of the jobs: `monit status`
  - `mariadb_ctrl`, `galera-healthcheck`, etc should all be `running`/`monitored`.

## Common Issues
- If you experience an error that looks something like:
> Received disconnect from 10.0.1.19: 2: Too many authentication failures for bosh_64898ue98
You likely have too many key identities loaded in your authentication agent. You can clear all of them using `ssh-add -D`.

First, you need to SSH into Ops Mgr.

Bosh deployments, target the cf deployment from the /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments folder

bosh vms | grep mysql-partition
