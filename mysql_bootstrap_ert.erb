Things you'll need to start
1. the key file from Ops Manager Director > Settings > SSH Private Key
1. the password for Director in Ops Manager Director > Credentials > Director


Steps:
1. `ssh-add foo.key`
1. ssh -A pcf.SYSTEM-DOMAN
1. `bosh target BoshDirectorIP`, enter director and the password from above
1. `bosh deployments`
1. `bosh vms cf-8c00fbbee829841ddad3 --details | grep mysql-partition`

Mess it up:
`bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 --hard && bosh -n stop mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2 --hard`

Bring the VMs back up:
`bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 0 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 1 && bosh -n start mysql-partition-16a9c50e8362a5857282 2`

Bosh deployments, target the cf deployment from the /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments folder

bosh vms | grep mysql-partition
