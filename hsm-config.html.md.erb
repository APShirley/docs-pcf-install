This topic describes how to prepare a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to store CredHub encryption keys. Storing CredHub encryption keys in an HSM is more secure than storing them internally.

Documentation for this feature was added in Pivotal Cloud Foundry v2.1 and does not exist for earlier versions.

For information about this feature in current versions of the documentation, see [Preparing CredHub HSMs for Configuration](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/hsm-config.html).
