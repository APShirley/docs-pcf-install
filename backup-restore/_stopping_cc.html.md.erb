1. From a command line, run `bosh deployment DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST` to select your PCF deployment. The manifest is located in <code>/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/</code> on the Ops Manager VM. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/cf-bd784.yml
    Deployment set to '/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/cf-bd784.yml'
    </pre>

1. Run `bosh vms CF-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` to view a list of VMs in your PCF deployment. `CF-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` corresponds to the name of your PCF release deployment, which is also the filename of your manifest file without the `.yml` ending. For example:
<pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh vms cf-bd784

</pre>

1. Run `bosh stop SELECTED-VM` for each Cloud Controller VM. For example, stop the `cloud_controller-partition-bd784` and `cloud_controller_worker-partition-bd784` VMs.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh stop cloud_controller-partition-bd784
    Acting as user 'director'...
    You are about to stop cloud_controller-partition-bd784/0
    Detecting deployment changes
    ----------------------------
    Stop cloud_controller-partition-bd784/0? (type 'yes' to continue)

    $ bosh stop cloud_controller_worker-partition-bd784
    Acting as user 'director'...
    You are about to stop cloud_controller_worker-partition-bd784/0
    Detecting deployment changes
    ----------------------------
    Stop cloud_controller_worker-partition-bd784/0? (type 'yes' to continue)
    </pre>

    Do not stop the `ccdb-partition` VM, which is the backend database for Cloud Controller if you opted to use PostgreSQL in your database deployment.
