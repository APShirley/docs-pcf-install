<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BBR is a beta feature in PCF v1.11.</p>

This topic describes the procedure for restoring your critical backend PCF components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have backed up Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) by following the steps in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

To restore PCF manually, see the <a href="restore-pcf.html">Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry Manually from Backup</a> topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can only use BBR to back up PCF v1.11 and later. To restore earlier versions of PCF, perform the <a href="restore-pcf.html">manual procedures</a>.</p>

The procedures described in this topic prepare your environment for PCF, deploy Ops Manager, import your installation settings, and use BBR to restore your PCF components.

## <a id='prepare-env'></a>Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Prepare your environment for PCF by following the instructions specific to your IaaS in <a href='../../installing/index.html'>Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>.

## <a id='deploy-import'></a>Step 2: Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings ##

1. Perform the procedures for your IaaS to deploy Ops Manager:
  * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on AWS](../cloudform-om-deploy.html)
  * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure](../azure-arm-template.html)
  * [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](../gcp-om-deploy.html)
  * [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](../openstack-setup.html)
  * [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../deploying-vm.html)

1. Access your new Ops Manager by navigating to `YOUR-OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser.

1. On the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, click **Import Existing Installation**.

    <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

1. In the import panel, perform the following tasks:
  * Enter your **Decryption Passphrase**.
  * Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation zip file that you exported in the <a href='./backup-pcf-bbr.html#export'>Step 3: Export Installation Settings</a> section of the <i>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</i> topic.

    <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

1. Click **Import**.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
      Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process,
      and may appear to hang.</p>

1. A **Successfully imported installation** message appears upon completion.

    <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/success.png") %>

## <a id="bosh-state"></a> Step 3: Remove BOSH State File

1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM. For more information, see the [SSH into Ops Manager](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em> topic.
1. On the Ops Manager VM, delete the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh-state.json` file.
1. Log into Ops Manager. For each tile that requires one, upload the required stemcell.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not click 'Apply Changes' at this time.</p>

## <a id="director-only"></a> Step 4: Apply changes to deploy only the BOSH Director

1. SSH into your jumpbox.
1. [Download](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases/latest) the latest version of `om-linux`, by running e.g. `wget https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases/download/0.23.0/om-linux`.
1. Make the downloaded binary executable by running e.g. `chmod +x om-linux`.
1. Run the following `om` command:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ om-linux -t OPS\_MANAGER\_URL -u OPS\_MANAGER\_ADMIN\_USER \
  -p OPS\_MANAGER\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD \
  -k curl -p /api/v0/installations -x POST -d \
  '{"deploy\_products": "none", "errands": {}, "ignore\_warnings": true }'
  </pre>
1. The director deploy will begin. Follow its progress in the Ops Manager UI.

## <a id="artifacts-jumpbox"></a> Step 5: Transfer Artifacts to Jumpbox

In the [Step 9: Back Up Your Deployment](./backup-pcf-bbr.html#bbr-backup) section of the <em>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</em> topic, you moved the TAR and metadata files of the backup artifact off your jumpbox to your preferred storage space. Now you must transfer those files back to your jumpbox.

For instance, you could SCP the backup artifact to your jumpbox:
  <pre class="terminal">$ scp LOCAL\_PATH\_TO\_BACKUP\_ARTIFACT JUMPBOX\_USER/JUMPBOX\_ADDRESS</pre>

## <a id="retrieve"></a> Step 6: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director and the credentials for logging in:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director' %>

## <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 7: Identify Your Deployment

After logging in to your BOSH Director, run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF.

The following example displays information for a BOSH deployment named `cf-example`:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh-cli -e [environment] -d [deployment-name] deployments
Name                     Release(s)
cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                         cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                         binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                         capi/1.28.0
                         cf-autoscaling/91
                         cf-mysql/35
                         ...
</pre>

## <a id='restore-bosh'></a> Step 8: Restore the BOSH Director

1. SSH into your jumpbox.
1. Using the same `om` binary as in [Step 4: Apply changes to deploy only the BOSH Director](#director-only), run:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ om-linux -t OPS\_MANAGER\_URL -u OPS\_MANAGER\_ADMIN\_USER \
  -p OPS\_MANAGER\_ADMIN\_PASSWORD \
  -k curl -p /api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr\_ssh\_credentials
  </pre>
1. Copy the value for `private_key_pem`, beginning with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` to your clipboard.
1. Run `printf -- "[pasted_private_key]" > PRIVATE_KEY`. This will reformat the key and save it to a file called `PRIVATE_KEY` in the current directory.
1. Ensure the BOSH Director backup artifact is in the folder you will run BBR from.
1. Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore the BOSH Director:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ nohup bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE\_KEY \
    --username bbr
    --host HOST \
    restore
  </pre>
  Use the optional `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. See the [Logging](backup-pcf-bbr.html#logging) section of the <em>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</em> topic for more information.
  <br><br>
  Replace the placeholder values as follows:
  * `PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY`: This is the path to the private key file you created above.
  * `HOST`: This is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, this will be a URL, e.g. https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com. Otherwise, it will be the `BOSH_DIRECTOR_IP`, which you retrieved in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR restore command can take a long time to complete. Pivotal recommends you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

If the commands completes successfully, continue to [Step 9: Remove stale cloud IDs for all deployments](#bosh-cck).

If the command fails, do the following:

1. Ensure all the parameters in the command are set.
1. Ensure the BOSH Director credentials are valid.
1. Ensure the specified deployment exists.
1. Ensure the source deployment is incompatible with the target deployment.
1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.

## <a id="bosh-cck"></a> Step 9: Remove stale cloud IDs for all deployments
For **every deployment** in the BOSH Director, run this command:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh-cli -e [environment] -d [deployment-name] -n cck \
--resolution delete\_disk\_reference \
--resolution delete\_vm\_reference
</pre>
This will reconcile the BOSH Director's internal state with the state in the IaaS. You can use the list of deployments returned in [Step 7: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the <code>bosh-cli cck</code> command does not successfully delete disk references, e.g. if you see <code>Scanning 19 persistent disks: 19 OK, 0 missing ...</code>, please follow the additional instructions in <a href="#removing-disks">Appendix: Removing Unused Disks</a>.</p>

## <a id='restore-ert'></a> Step 10: Apply Changes
Navigate to Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.

## <a id='restore-ert'></a> Step 11: Restore Elastic Runtime

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**. This deploys Elastic Runtime.

1. If the Elastic Runtime backup artifact has been moved from the jumpbox, put it back into the directory bbr is run from.

1. Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore Elastic Runtime:
<pre class="terminal">
$ BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=BOSH_PASSWORD \
  bbr deployment
  --target BOSH\_DIRECTOR\_IP \
  --username BOSH\_CLIENT \
  --deployment DEPLOYMENT\_NAME \
  --ca-cert PATH\_TO\_BOSH\_SERVER\_CERT \
  restore </pre>

    Replace the placeholder values as follows:
    * `BOSH_CLIENT`, `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Use the BOSH UAA user provided in  **Pivotal Ops Manager > Credentials > Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**.
    * `BOSH_DIRECTOR_IP`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 3: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve) section.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: You retrieved this value in the [Step 4: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment) section.
    * `PATH_TO_BOSH_SERVER_CERT`: This is the path to the BOSH Director’s Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, if the certificate is not verifiable by the local machine’s certificate chain.

## <a id='removing-disks'></a> Appendix: Removing Unused Disks

If `bosh-cli cck` does not clean up all disk references, there are disks from a previous deployment in the IaaS which will prevent recreated deployments from working.

To clean up these disks, either:

* target the redeployed BOSH Director using the BOSH CLI, list deployments and delete each deployment using `bosh-cli -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME delete-deployment`, or
* manually log into your IaaS account and delete the disks by hand.

Once the disks are deleted, continue with [Step 9: Remove stale cloud IDs for all deployments](#bosh-cck).
