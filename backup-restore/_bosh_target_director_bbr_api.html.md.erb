1. Install the [BOSH v2 CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install) on a machine outside of your PCF deployment.
1. Perform the procedures in the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic to authenticate and access the Ops Manager API.
1. Use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/products` endpoint to retrieve a list of deployed products, replacing `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` with the access token recorded in the [Using the Ops Manager API](../ops-man-api.html) topic:
	<pre class="terminal">$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products" \ 
    -X GET \ 
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
1. In the response to the above request, locate the product with an `installation_name` starting with `p-bosh-` and copy its `guid`.
1. Run the following `curl` command, replacing `PRODUCT-GUID` with the value of `guid` from the previous step:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products/PRODUCT-GUID/static\_ips" \ 
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
1. In the response to the above request, locate the BOSH Director IP address under the `ips` field.
1. Run the following `curl` command to retrieve the BOSH Director credentials:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/director_credentials" \ 
    -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
1. From the command line, log into the BOSH Director using the IP address and credentials that you recorded:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh -e DIRECTOR_IP --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate log-in
  Email (): director
  Password (): *******************
  Successfully authenticated with UAA
  Succeeded
  </pre>
