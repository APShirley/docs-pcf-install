This topic describes the operational impact of backing up Pivotal Application Service (PAS) components with BBR. To ensure correctness of backups, each component that requires backup has its own set of scripts. The sections in this topic describe the behavior of each component during backup.

The [App Autoscaler service](../../appsman-services/autoscaler/using-autoscaler.html) is unavailable during backup. You cannot access the UI or API. 

The backup process for App Autoscaler is as follows:

<p class="note"><strong></strong>: The App Autoscaler service runs as a set of Cloud Foundry apps in the <code>system</code> org.</p>

1. **Pre-backup lock**: The Autoscaler apps in the `system` org stop. This lock occurs before the CAPI and UAA components lock. 
1. **Backup**: The BBR SDK backup script runs.
1. **Post-backup unlock**: The Autoscaler apps in the `system` org start again. This unlock occurs after the CAPI and UAA components unlock. 

Because the database for App Autoscaler is small, the majority of downtime comes from stopping and starting the apps.
