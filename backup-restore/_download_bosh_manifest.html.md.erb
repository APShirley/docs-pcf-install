1. Run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of your current BOSH deployment:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh deployments
  +-------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | Name        | Release(s)   | Stemcell(s)                                     |
  +-------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | cf-example  | cf-mysql/10  | bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/2690.3 |
  |             | cf/183.2     |                                                 |
  +-------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

1. Run `bosh download manifest DEPLOYMENT-NAME LOCAL-SAVE-NAME` to download and
save each BOSH deployment manifest. You need this manifest to locate information about your databases.
For each manifest, you will need to repeat these instructions. 
Replace `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` with the name of the current BOSH deployment.
For this procedure, use `cf.yml` as the `LOCAL-SAVE-NAME`.
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ bosh download manifest cf-example cf.yml
  Deployment manifest saved to `cf.yml'
  </pre>
