Pivotal recommends frequently backing up your deployment.

The complete state of an <%= vars.product_full %> deployment is captured by the following:

* [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation settings
* Critical databases:
	* Pivotal MySQL Server Database
	* Cloud Controller Database
	* UAA Database
	* Apps Manager Database
	* NFS Server Database

To back up a deployment, you must temporarily stop the Cloud Controller and save all of the above, as well as your database encryption credentials, to backup files. To restore a deployment, you must temporarily stop the Cloud Controller and restore the state of each component from the backup file.
