<% if $this_topic=='backup-pcf' %>

This topic describes the procedure for backing up each critical backend <%= vars.product_full %> component. Pivotal recommends frequently backing up your installation settings before making any changes to your PCF deployment, such as configuration of any tiles in Ops Manager.

To back up a deployment, export installation settings, download the BOSH Deployment Manifest, temporarily stop the Cloud Controller, create and export backup files for each critical backend component, and restart the Cloud Controller. It is also important to record your Cloud Controller Database encryption credentials which you will need if you contact Pivotal Support for help restoring your installation.

To restore your backup, see the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; from Backup](./restore-pcf.html) topic.

This topic describes the procedure for restoring <%= vars.product_full %> from a backup.

To create a backup, see the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](./backup-pcf.html) topic.

The complete recoverable state of an <%= vars.product_full %> deployment consists of the following:

* [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation settings
* Critical databases and NFS:
	* Cloud Controller Database 
	* UAA Database
	* NFS Server 
	* Apps Manager Database
	* MySQL Server Database

To restore a deployment, you must temporarily stop the Cloud Controller, import installation settings, and restore the state of each component from its backup file.
