The complete recoverable state of an <%= vars.product_full %> deployment consists of the following:

* [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) installation settings
* Critical databases and NFS:
	* Cloud Controller Database 
	* UAA Database
	* NFS Server 
	* Apps Manager Database
	* MySQL Server Database

To back up a deployment, you must temporarily stop the Cloud Controller, export installation settings, create and export backup files for the above components, and record your database encryption credentials.

To restore a deployment, you must temporarily stop the Cloud Controller, import installation settings, and restore the state of each component from its backup file.
