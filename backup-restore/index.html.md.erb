To create a backup, see the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./backup-pcf.html) topic.

* If your deployment uses external databases (for example, AWS RDS) then you must back up your data according to the instructions provided by your database provider.

* If your PCF deployment originated from 1.5.x or earlier, follow the backup/restore instructions for PostgreSQL databases and for the MySQL server.

* If your PCF deployment originated from 1.6.0 or later, follow the backup/restore instructions for the  MySQL server (but not those for PostgreSQL databases).

* If you do not know the original version of your PCF deployment, perform the following steps to determine what databases your deployment uses:
	1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Pivotal Elastic Runtime**.
	1. Click **Databases** to determine whether your deployment uses internal databases with MySQL and PostgresQL, internal databases with MySQL only, or external databases.
