This documentation explains how to install runtime environments for applications and containers, to enable the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) platform.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

Runtime environments are what PCF exists to provide. PCF includes runtime environment options that support apps and containers running on Linux and Windows VMs at different levels of resource usage and isolation:

* **Elastic Runtime** lets developers develop and manage cloud-native apps and software services running on Linux.
	- Elastic Runtime is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Elastic Runtime project.

* **PKS** (Pivotal Container Service) lets operators provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters on PCF.
  - PKS is based on the open-source [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](http://docs-cfcr.cfapps.io/) project.

* **Elastic Runtime for Windows 2012R2** lets PCF host apps on Windows 2012R2 VMs and enables PCF developers to push .NET apps to these Windows cells.
	- You must install Elastic Runtime before you can install Elastic Runtime for Windows 2012R2.

* **PCF Isolation Segment** extends Elastic Runtime to run apps in separate _segments_ with their own isolated computing, routing, and logging resource pools.
	- Operators replicate and configure an Isolation Segment tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
	- You must install Elastic Runtime before you can install Isolation Segment.
