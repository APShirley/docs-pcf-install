Pivotal defines an Availability Zone (AZ) as an operator-assigned, functionally independent segment of network infrastructure. In cases of partial infrastructure failure, [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Elastic Runtime distributes and balances all instances of running applications across remaining AZs. Strategic use of Availability Zones contributes to the fault tolerance and high availability of a Elastic Runtime deployment.

## <a id="azs-vmware"></a>AZ Differences Between VMware Products ##

Elastic Runtime on VMware vSphere supports distributing deployments across multiple AZs. See the section on AZs in [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](./vsphere-config.html#az). VMware vCloud and vCloud Air support only one AZ, which is the virtual data center you access with <a href="./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html#access-interface">vShield Edge Gateway Services interface</a>.

## <a id="example-case"></a>Balancing Across AZs During Failure: Example Scenario ##

An operator scales an application to four instances in an Elastic Runtime environment distributed across three availability zones: A1, A2, and A3. The environment allocates the instances according to the [DEA Placement Algorithm](../concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html#dea-placement):

If A1 experiences a power outage or hardware failure, the two application instances running in A1 terminate while the application instances in zones A2 and A3 continue to run:

If A1 remains unavailable, Elastic Runtime balances new instances of the application across the remaining availability zones:
