In Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.12 and earlier, deploying PCF on AWS uses CloudFormation, not Terraform.

AWS Terraform templates were added to Pivotal Network in the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.0 release and replaces the PCF CloudFormation for AWS Setup file on Pivotal Network.

For more information, see the following:

* **PCF v1.10**: [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](./cloudform.html)

* **For PCF v2.0 and later**: [Installing PCF on AWS using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/aws-terraform.html).
