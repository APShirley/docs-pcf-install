Confirm that you have adequate disk space for your upgrades. To upgrade PCF (Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime), you need at least 20 GB of free disk space. Subsequently, the amount of disk space required depends on how many tiles you plan to deploy to your upgraded PCF deployment. To check current persistent disk usage, from the **Installation Dashboard**, select the <strong>Ops Manager Director</strong> tile. Select <strong>Status</strong> and review the value of the `PERS. DISK` column. If persistent disk usage is higher than 50%, select <strong>Settings > Resource Config</strong>, and increase your persistent disk space to handle the size of the resources. If in doubt, set the value to at least 100 GB.
