This topic describes how to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on vSphere with NSX-T, using the VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF.

##<a id='introduction'></a>Introduction

PAS 2.0 uses a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin to support secure and direct internal communication between containers. This plugin can be:

* The internal Silk plugin that comes packaged with PAS, or
* On vSphere, the [VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/vmware-nsx-t), which installs as an Ops Manager tile.

##<a id='requirements'></a>Requirements

* Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) 2.0: PAS 2.0 and Ops Manager 2.0 installed and configured on vSphere.
  - See [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to vSphere](./deploying-vm.html)
* VMWare NSX-T container plugin for PCF 2.1.0 tile: downloaded from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
* NSX-T 2.1 environment with NSX-T components installed and configured: see the [NSX-T Cookbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hw7USpyMZpKoT5MvSaP9NcnTHsdvMd_w0EGZ19cL8nQ).

##<a id='architecture'></a>Architecture

The following diagram shows how to deploy an NSX-T machine to run PAS across multiple vSphere hardware clusters. NSX-T runs a Tier-0 (T0) router and multiple Tier-1 (T1) routers, each connecting to a network within Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Each vSphere hardware column cluster corresponds to an Availability Zone in PCF:

![NSX &amp; PAS Overview](nsx-t/nsx-t-refarch.png)

When a PCF operator creates a new Org, the NSX-T plugin triggers NSX-T to create a new T1 router and allocate an address range for the Org, on demand.

##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure PAS and NSX-T

Installing NSX-T to run with PAS requires the following actions, which are described below:

1. [Set up NSX-T to Integrate with PAS](#nsx-t-setup)

1. [Enable NSX-T Mode in the BOSH Director](#nsx-t-mode)

1. [Enable External Networking in PAS](#external-net)

1. [Install and Configure the NSX-T Tile](#nsx-t-tile)

###<a id='nsx-t-setup'></a> Set up NSX-T to Integrate with PAS

1.  In vSphere, create logical network switches to correspond to the networks that PCF uses.
  1. Log into the **NSX Manager Dashboard**.  
  1. Open the **Switching** tab.
  1. For each of these networks...
      - **Infrastructure** (BOSH and Ops Manager, defined in BOSH Director tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)
      - **Deployment** (PAS, defined in PAS tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)
      - **Services** and **Dynamic Services** (marketplace services and on-demand services, also defined in the PAS tile)
      - **Isolation Segment** (optional, defined in the Isolation Segment tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)  
...do the following:
          1. Click **Add New Logical Switch**.
          1. Enter a name for the logical switch (e.g. `infrastructure-ls`, `deployment-ls`).
          1. Click **Save**.

1. Create T0 network address translation (NAT) rules to facilitate communication between Ops Manager and the BOSH Director.
  1. Create and configure a T0 router and router port for PCF.
  1. In NSX Manager, select your T0 Router and navigate to **Services** > **NAT**.
  1. Add a rule for destination NAT (DNAT) with:
      - The externally-specified destination IP address of incoming requests
      - The internal network address to translate the external address to
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-dnat-rule.png)
  1. Add a rule for source NAT (SNAT) with:
      - The range of internal addresses that outgoing traffic may come from
      - The external IP address to put in each outgoing packet header, indicating its source
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-snat-rule.png)

1. Create T1 Routers for PAS.
  - Create T1 routers that connect from the T0 router. For each PCF network, Infrastructure, Deployment, and so on, create a T1 router as follows: 
      1. In the NSX Manager UI, navigate to **Routing** > **Routers**
      1. Click **Add** > **Tier-1 Router**.
      1. Configure the router. For example, the Infrastructure network router configuration might look like:
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-t1-router.png)

1. Create T1 router ports for PAS.
  - For each T1 router you created, add a **New Router Port** as follows, to to allow traffic in and out:
      1. In the NSX Manager UI, select the T1 router.
      1. In **Configuration** > **Router Ports**, add a new router port.
      1. For **Logical Switch**, enter the name of the logical switch you defined for the network in **Add New Logical Switch**, above.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-router-port.png)

1. Advertise the T1 routes for each PAS T1 router.
  - Advertise the routes of the T1 routers to the T0 router, so that it can correctly route incoming requests based on their destination IP address:
      1. Select your T1 Router and navigate to **Routing** > **Route Advertisement**.
      1. Under **Edit Route Advertisement Configuration**, enable route advertisement by setting **Status** to **Enabled**.
      1. Set **Advertise All NSX Connected Routes** to **Yes**.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-route-advertise.png)

1. Add a tag for the T0 router.
  1. From NSX Manager, click **router-t0 - Manage Tags**
  1. Click **+ ADD** and enter a unique identifier for the router, to associate it with PAS.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-t0-router-tags.png)

1. Allocate an IP Block for PAS Orgs.
  1. From NSX Manager, navigate to **DDI** > **IPAM** > **New IP block**.
  1. Enter a description, such as `This is where IP addresses come from when a new Org is created in PAS.`
  1. Enter a CIDR to allocate an address block large enough to accommodate all PAS apps.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-ip-block.png)
  - Add a tag to the newly-created IP block.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-t0-router.png)

1. Create a switching profile.
  - Create a new switching profile with the following fields and tags:
      - **Name**: `ncp-ha`
      - **Type**: `Spoof Guard`
      - **Tags**: Add a tag with **Scope** `ncp/ha`, **Tag** `True`
      - **Tags**: Add a second tag with the **Scope** and **Tag** name of the T0 router tag you defined above.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-switching-profile.png)

1. Create an external SNAT IP pool.
  1. Navigate to **Inventory** > **Groups** > **IP Pools** > **New IP Pool**.
  1. Enter a name and a description.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-edit-ips.png)
  1. Add two tags to the SNAT IP pool.
