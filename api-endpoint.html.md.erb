title: Identifying the API Endpoint for your Elastic Runtime Instance
---

The API endpoint, or target URL, for your Elastic Runtime instance is the URL of
the Cloud Controller in your Elastic Runtime instance.
Find your API endpoint by consulting your cloud operator, from the Developer Console, or from the command line.

## <a id='console'></a>From the Developer Console ##

Log in to the Developer Console for your Elastic Runtime instance, then click
**Tools** in the left navigation panel.
The **Getting Started** section of the Tools page shows your API endpoint.

## <a id='cli'></a>From the Command Line ##

From a command line, use the `cf api` command to view your API endpoint.

Example:

<pre class='termnial'>
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.example.com (API version: 2.2.0)
</pre>
