The Small Footprint Runtime tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is not available in PCF v1.11 and earlier.

You can use the Small Footprint Runtime for testing or small on-site data centers where performance is less important than cost.

You must install PCF v1.12 or higher to install the Small Footprint Runtime.

For more information, see [Getting Started with Small Footprint PAS](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/small-footprint.html)
