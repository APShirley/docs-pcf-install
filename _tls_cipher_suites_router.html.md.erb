In the **TLS Cipher Suites for Router** field, specify the TLS cipher suites to use in Gorouter communications. Use an ordered, colon-delimited list of [Golang-supported TLS cipher suites](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/) in the OpenSSL format. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, specify the cipher suites used by the older version of TLS. For a list of older TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers).
