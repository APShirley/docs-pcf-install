title: Connecting Elastic Runtime to LDAP
---

This topic describes connecting [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) Elastic Runtime to LDAP by integrating the Cloud
Foundry User Account and Authentication server with LDAP.

The Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication
([UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/tree/develop)) server provides
identity management for Elastic Runtime in three ways:

* Issues tokens for use by client applications when they act on behalf of
Elastic Runtime users
* Authenticates users with their Elastic Runtime credentials
* Acts as an SSO service using Elastic Runtime or other credentials

You can integrate the UAA with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
server.
Connecting Elastic Runtime to LDAP allows the UAA to authenticate users using
LDAP search and bind operations.

##<a id='configure'></a>Configuring the LDAP Endpoint ##

To integrate the UAA with LDAP, configure Elastic Runtime with your LDAP
endpoint information as follows:

1. Log into the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager web interface.

1. On the Product Dashboard, select **Pivotal Elastic Runtime**.

1. In the left navigation menu, select **LDAP Config**.

1. Enter the following LDAP endpoint configuration information:
    * **LDAP Server URL**: A URL pointing to the LDAP server.
This must include one of the following protocols:
        * `ldap://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses an unencrypted
		connection.
        * `ldaps://`: This specifies that the LDAP server uses SSL for an
		encrypted connection and requires that the LDAP server holds a trusted
		certificate or that you import a trusted certificate to the JVM
		truststore.
    * **LDAP Credentials**: The LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) and password for
	binding to the LDAP Server. Example DN: `cn=administrator,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
    Note: We recommend that you provide LDAP credentials that grant read-only
	permissions on the LDAP Search Base and the LDAP Group Search Base.
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Search Base**: The location in the LDAP directory tree from which
	any LDAP User search begins.
	The typical LDAP Search Base matches your domain name.
<br /><br />
    For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following
	LDAP User Search Base: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Search Filter**: A string that defines LDAP User search criteria.
	These search criteria allow LDAP to perform more effective and efficient
	searches. For example, the standard LDAP search filter `cn=Smith` returns
	all objects with a common name equal to `Smith`.
<br /><br />
	In the LDAP search filter string that you use to configure Elastic Runtime,
	use `{0}` instead of the username.
	For example, use `cn={0}` to return all LDAP objects with the same common
	name as the username.
<br /><br />
    In addition to `cn`, other attributes commonly searched for and returned are
	`mail`, `uid` and, in the case of Active Directory, `sAMAccountName`.
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Group Search Base**: The location in the LDAP directory tree from
	which the LDAP Group search begins.
<br /><br />
    For example, a domain named "cloud.example.com" typically uses the following
	LDAP Group Search Base: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`
<br /><br />
    * **LDAP Group Search Filter**: A string that defines LDAP Group search
	criteria. The standard value is `member={0}`.

##<a id='clients'></a>UAA Clients ##

In addition to any users or client applications that LDAP defines, UAA creates
and authenticates default users defined in the `uaa.yml` file on the UAA VM.

UAA installs the following clients:

* admin
* autoscaling_service
* cc\_service\_broker\_client
* cf
* cloud_controller
* login
* portal
* system_passwords

Use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC) to edit which default users the
`uaa.yml` file defines. For information about the UAAC, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)](../adminguide/uaa-user-management.html).
