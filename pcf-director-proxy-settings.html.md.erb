<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the setup and scope of the BOSH CPI Proxy settings found in the setup page.

## <a id='scope'></a>BOSH Director Proxy Setting Scope ##

Proxy settings were added to BOSH and Ops Manager to provide a way to proxy http requests from the BOSH CPI to the IaaS endpoints for each IaaS. 
As of the latest modification of this document â€” the proxy settings are limited to the BOSH CPI and IaaS endpoints. 
Proxying blobstore (S3) and database traffic (RDS) from the BOSH director is being considered by the Pivotal platform team as is the proxying of 
traffic from Pivotal tiles such as Elastic Runtime.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
   * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
   * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

1. For either option you must enter HTTP or HTTPS proxy URLs.

1. Enter IP addresses that will not be proxied in the No Proxy field including the following:
   * The BOSH Director IP must be in the **No Proxy** field. The BOSH Director IP will be the first IP that is not in your blocked range. For example, if you enter `10.0.16.0-10.0.16.10` in the **Reserved IP Ranges** field of the networks page, the BOSH Director IP will be `10.0.16.11`.
   * 127.0.0.1
