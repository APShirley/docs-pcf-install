## Diego-SSH CLI Plugin

The easiest way to start an SSH session into a Cloud-Foundry-deployed app instance is to use the [SSH plugin for the CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh/releases).

You can use CF CLI v6.10.0 or higher to install the SSH plugin from the CF-Community repo:
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community http://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/
$ cf install-plugin Diego-SSH -r CF-Community
</pre>

If your app is running on Diego with SSH enabled and your operator has configured SSH access to be publicly routable, run `cf ssh APP-NAME` in the terminal to start an interactive SSH session in instance index 0 of your app.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf ssh my-awesome-app
</pre>

To target a different instance index with `cf ssh`, supply it via the `-i` flag.

The `cf ssh` command also supports executing commands inside the app instance and forwarding local ports to it via the `-L` flag.

## CF Authenticator access

It is also possible to connect to your SSH-enabled app instance via other SSH clients. If SSH is configured for your deployment, Cloud Controller's `/v2/info` endpoint contains an `app_ssh_endpoint` field with the domain name and port for the externally available SSH endpoint, and an `app_ssh_host_key_fingerprint` field with the fingerprint of the host key for the deployment. To connect to a particular instance of your app, run `ssh -p SSH-PORT cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX@SSH-DOMAIN`.

The password is a UAA-issued authorization code for a user authorized to modify that app, such as a user with the SpaceDeveloper role in the app's space. Such a code can be obtained via the Diego-SSH plugin's `get-ssh-code` command, or directly from the UAA `/oauth/authorize` endpoint.

Transferring files with `scp` is invoked similarly, although the user name must be specified with the `-o` flag because of the `:` character present in it. For example, to copy a file out of the instance, run

`ssh -P SSH-PORT -o User=cf:APP-GUID/APP-INSTANCE-INDEX SSH-DOMAIN:REMOTE-FILE-TO-RETRIEVE LOCAL-FILE-DESTINATION`

More details on the CF Authenticator can be found in the [Diego-SSH README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh/blob/master/README.md#cloud-foundry-via-cloud-controller-and-uaa).
