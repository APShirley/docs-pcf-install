<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The Diego-SSH package enables SSH access to [Diego Cell](../../concepts/diego/diego-components.html#cell-components) containers, allowing developers to access running app instances.

## <a id='into'></a> Introduction

## <a id='proxy'></a> Diego-SSH Proxy ##

The ssh proxy hosts the user-accessible ssh endpoint and is responsible for authentication, policy enforcement, and access controls in the context of Cloud Foundry. After a user has successfully authenticated with the proxy, the proxy will attempt to locate the target container and create an ssh session to a daemon running inside the container. After both sessions have been established, the proxy will manage the communication between the user's ssh client and the container's ssh daemon.

For more information about authentication and daemon discover, see [Diego-SSH Proxy](./proxy.html)


## <a id='daemon'></a> Diego-SSH Daemon ##

The ssh daemon is a lightweight implementation that is built around the Go ssh library. It supports command execution, interactive shells, local port forwarding, and scp. The daemon is self-contained and has no dependencies on the container root file system.

The daemon is focused on delivering basic access to application instances in Cloud Foundry. It is intended to run as an unprivileged process and interactive shells and commands will run as the daemon user. The daemon only supports one authorized key is not intended to support multiple users.

The daemon can be made available on a file server and Diego LRPs that want to use it can include a download action to acquire the binary and a run action to start it. Cloud Foundry applications will download the daemon as part of the lifecycle bundle.
