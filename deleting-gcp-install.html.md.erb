When you deploy [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with a PCF deployment. You can use the GCP console to remove an installation of all components, but retain the objects in your bucket for a future deployment.

1. Log into your GCP Console and select the project for your deployment.
 	
1. Navigate to your **Compute Engine**. Select all the **Instances**.
 
1. Stop and then delete all your instances.

1. Select **Networking** and then the network you created for PCF. Delete this network.

1. Select **Networking** and **Load Balancers**.  Delete all load balancers.
